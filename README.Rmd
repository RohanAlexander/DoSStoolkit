## DoSStoolkit <img src="man/figures/stitches_hex_all.png" align="right" height="200" />

The DoSS Toolkit is a bunch of self-paced modules to help you learn and use R.

We all know that R is a critical part of applied statistics and data science these days, but it can have a steep learning curve and be intimidating to get started with. 

The [Department of Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) (DoSS) toolkit is a free series of open source online modules written by undergraduates, that their fellow students and the public can use to learn the essentials of R. 


## How to use this resource

### If you have never used R before

You use this resource by running R code! This may sound intimidating if you've never used R before, so we've made a video that walks through what you need to do. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mymJEEXux4?start=3" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Get started by going to R Studio Cloud - https://rstudio.cloud - and creating an account. When you've signed up, start a new project, and copy-paste the code below to install packages. (If you already have R and R Studio working on your local computer then you don't have to use R Studio Cloud, you can install the packages on your local machine instead.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('remotes')
install.packages('opendatatoronto')
remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
```

Then you can install the `DoSStoolkit`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("RohanAlexander/DoSStoolkit")
```

You'll use the function `run_tutorial` to run each module. At the moment we have nine modules. So you can pick one to start with. For instance, if you wanted to run the 'hello world' module then run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("hello_world", package = "DoSStoolkit")
```


### If you already have R and R Studio on your computer

You can install `DoSStoolkit` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RohanAlexander/heapsofpapers")

# install.packages('tidyverse')
# install.packages('remotes')
# install.packages('opendatatoronto')
remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
```

Then you can install the `DoSStoolkit`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("RohanAlexander/DoSStoolkit")
```

You'll use the function `run_tutorial` to run each module. At the moment we have ten modules. So you can pick one to start with. For instance, if you wanted to run the 'hello world' module then run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("hello_world", package = "DoSStoolkit")
```

- Mariam Walaa is an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at University of Toronto Scarborough, majoring in Mathematics and minoring in GIS and statistics. Mariam enjoys learning about how to work with data such as spatial and text data to extract insights.
- Marija Pejcinovska is a graduate student in the Department of Statistical Sciences. Her research is motivated by modelling challenges that arise with "complicated" data (sparse/highly biased/poor quality data), usually in the context of social or health inequalities.
- Matthew Wankiewicz is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Mathematics and the History and Philosophy of Science.
- Michael Chong is a graduate student in the Department of Statistical Sciences. His research aims to build statistical models for demographic estimation in contexts where high quality data are unavailable. There is almost always an active R session on his computer!
- Paul Hodgetts is a Master of Information candidate concentrating in Human-Centred Data Science in the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto. He sincerely believes that Calvin and Hobbes is the greatest comic ever produced.
- Rohan Alexander is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Information and the Department of Statistical Sciences. Some people convert to catholicism upon marriage, Rohan converted to R. His greatest professional achievement is probably getting a pull request accepted into R for Data Science (it was just fixing a minor typo but still).
- Samantha-Jo Caetano is an assistant professor (teaching stream) in the Department of Statistical Sciences. She loves statistics, socializing, her family, and her dogs, not necessarily in that order.
- Shirley Deng is an undergraduate student specializing in Statistics and majoring in Mathematics. Meticulous and soft-hearted, she often finds herself engrossed in new pastimes by the second at the influence of her peers. One of which that has remained a longtime constant - spending an excessive amount of time helping people debug their R code.
- Yena Joo is an undergraduate student majoring in Economics and double minoring in Statistics and Computer Science.
