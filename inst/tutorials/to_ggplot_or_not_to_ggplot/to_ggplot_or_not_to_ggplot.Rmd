## Introduction

I hope that this module will make you love plotting your data. When you're using data, there's almost nothing more important than just showing the data that you're interested in. The `ggplot2` package has become the go-to for graphing in R.

It's a powerful and versatile tool and I think that you're going to love learning about it.


















## `ggplot2::ggplot()`

Written by Shirley Deng.


### Introduction to `ggplot()` through the scatterplot

Have you ever made a plot in base R? It's not very pretty. 

Consider the **scatterplot**. 

#### What is a scatterplot?

In a scatterplot, each observation is graphed as a point on a grid with axes x and y. 

We determine the position of each point based on the values of two numerical variables: the horizontal x-axis, and the vertical y-axis. 

#### Let's look at an example of a scatterplot

We can make one right now using the built-in `mtcars` dataset to take a look - below is a scatterplot made with base R.

``` {r, ggplot-base-ex}
plot(x = mtcars$wt, 
     y = mtcars$mpg,
     main = "Miles vs. Weight", 
     xlab = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
     ylab = "Miles per US Gallon",
     pch = 16
)
```

Alternatively, we can make the same plot with the `ggplot2` package, using `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`.

``` {r, ggplot-alt-ex}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

But `ggplot2` also allows us to customize our plots, and even plot them together as one figure.

``` {r, ggplot-alt-ex-pretty}
library(ggpubr)

base_plot <- mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg))

grey_plot <- base_plot +
  geom_point(color = "#7570b3") +
  labs(x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per US Gallon", 
       caption = "Using theme_grey()") +
  theme_grey()

minimal_plot <- base_plot + 
  geom_point(color = "#66a61e") +
  labs(x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", y = NULL, 
       caption = "Using theme_minimal()") +
  theme_minimal()

theme_plots <- ggarrange(grey_plot, minimal_plot)
theme_plots_title <- text_grob("Miles vs. Weight", face = "bold")
annotate_figure(theme_plots, top = theme_plots_title)
```

Looks cleaner, right? Or at least more fun.

### Using `ggplot()`

#### What is `ggplot()` for?

`ggplot2` is a package that allows us to make graphics in R. It's a part of the `tidyverse`, so when you load the `tidyverse` package, you've loaded `ggplot2` too.

```{r ggplot-setup, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The `ggplot2::ggplot()` function is used to initialize plots in R. We use it to indicate the base of our plot - what **data** we're working with, and any plot **aesthetics** we'll be using.

From there, we can add on layers to specify what the actual plots will be. This includes information on the **type of graph** we want, what we want its **axes** to look like, what we want its **labels** to look like, etc. 

It may seem farfetched now, in the middle of a *panoramic*, but imagine going to a restaurant to eat. 

You'd get seated in the restaurant you're going to eat in before you start to order food. We can think of `ggplot()` as getting seated in the restaurant, and adding additional layers as ordering food. You can add as many layers as you want at any time, just like how you can also order as many menu items as you want at any time.


#### What arguments does `ggplot()` take?

* `.data`: the dataframe we're working with as a base
* `.mapping`: the aesthetics we're working with as a base - more on this below.

#### What are aesthetics?

That's a separate course in philosophy. 

But, for our purposes, this argument is used to specify **which variables** of the dataframe we want to use for our plot's axes, among other options.

For example, with our `mtcars` example from earlier, we wanted the `wt` variable on the x-axis and the `mpg` variable on the y-axis, so we used `mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)`.

##### Exercise 1

What if we wanted to switch the axes, with `mpg` on the x-axis and `wt` on the x-axis? Try completing the code below to generate the plot.

```{r ggplot-exercise1, exercise=TRUE}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes( , )) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Weight vs. Miles", 
       x = "Miles per US Gallon",
       y = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)")
```

```{r ggplot-exercise1-hint}
aes(x = mpg, y = wt)
```

#### What else do we need to use `ggplot()` ? **Layers**

Once we've set our `ggplot()` aesthetics, we need to specify what exactly we want to plot by using **layers**. This includes the **type of plot** - we use geom layers to do so.

##### Geoms

Some common geoms include:

* `geom_bar()` - bar plot
* `geom_boxplot()` - box and whiskers plot
* `geom_histogram()` - histogram
* `geom_point()` - scatterplot

In Exercise 1 and our previous examples, we used `geom_point()` to specify that we wanted to plot a scatterplot.

##### Example 1 - the `+`

Let's take a look at the following example:

```{r ggplot-example1, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon")
```

After we called `ggplot()`, we used a `+` to **connect** it with our `geom_point()`.

Similarly, we added another layer - **labels**. We used another `+` to connect the labels `labs()` with the rest of the figure.

##### Themes 

There are also layers for changing the **appearance** of our plots. For example, we can use the **theme** `theme_void()` to remove the axes and axes' labels:

```{r ggplot-example1-void}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme_void()
```

Not the ideal theme for this plot, since removing the axes and their labels leaves us with little information on what's being plotted. But, we know we have the option to change the theme!

A list of themes can be found in the `ggplot2` documentation [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html).

### Handy Layers

We were introduced to geoms, labels and themes in the previous section. 

But there are a number of other layers you might find handy for making plots and figures with `ggplot()`:

##### Labels

We saw earlier that we could specify labels using `labs()`, like in Example 1: 

```{r ggplot-labels1}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon")
```

But we can also make the *exact* same plot by **specifying labels separately**, in their own layers, with `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`, and `ylab()`:

```{r ggplot-labels2}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Miles vs. Weight") + 
  xlab("Car Weight (1000 lbs)") +
  ylab("Miles per US Gallon")
```

##### Adjusting title positions using the **theme** layer

Notice from our Labels section examples that by default, `ggplot()` will position our titles to the left.

We can position the title to the centre using the theme layer: `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))`:

```{r ggplot-titlecentre}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

Similarly, we can adjust the title to the left with `hjust=0` (the default), or to the right with `hjust=1`:

###### To the left, to the left...

```{r ggplot-titleleft}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0))
```

###### Writing to the right-ing

```{r ggplot-titleright}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=1))
```

##### Axis scale limits

Notice how in our previous plots, the y-axis started at 10. 

But this doesn't give us an accurately scaled representation of the relationship between the x-axis and y-axis variables, so we may prefer to start the y-axis at 0 instead.

We can change the axis scale limits using the `xlim()` and `ylim()` layers.

Here, we set the x-axis scale to range from 0 to 6, and the y-axis scale to range from 0 to 35:

```{r ggplot-scalelim}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  xlim(0, 6) + 
  ylim(0, 35)
```

##### Axis text angle

Suppose we wanted to change the **orientation** of our axis labels' scales. 

We can do so with the `theme()` layer.

For example, we can rotate the y-axis scale labels by 90 degrees as so:

```{r ggplot-textangle}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Miles vs. Weight", 
       x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", 
       y = "Miles per US Gallon") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90))
```

Notice that this only changes the angle of the axis *scale* labels, and not the labels themselves!

We can similarly change the x-axis scale label using `axis.text.x` in place of `axis.text.y`.

## Bar charts

Written by Matthew Wankiewicz.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Plot bar charts using the `ggplot` package
- Customize bar charts with `ggplot`

Prerequisite skills include:

- Having `ggplot` installed and loaded
- Basic familiarity with `ggplot`

Highlights:

- Bar charts are the best way to display categorical data.
- The `ggplot` function allows you to customize your bar graphs.

### The content

When you encounter a dataset that does not include numerical data, the best way to visualize what you are working with is a bar chart. Generally, bar charts will have the categorical variable on the x-axis, and the count/percentage on the y-axis.

Bar charts are different from graphs like histograms because histograms display numerical variables while bar charts work best for categorical.

Bar charts are useful for getting a view of how your data looks and seeing which groups appear the most. 

### Arguments

The main arguments for making bar charts is part of the `ggplot` function:

- **data:** This represents the dataset you plan to use. You can either write `data = dataframe` or you can pipe the dataset into `ggplot`.
- **`aes():`** This is where you place the argument that decides which variable you are focusing on.
  - `x = variable:` This is the variable you want to display.
  - `fill = variable:` This can change the fill of your bar depending on the different options in your variable. 
- **`geom_bar():`** This is where you put any arguments to change the looks of your graph, whether it's colour or size of the bars.
  - **`fill:`** This argument decides the colour of the inside of the bars.
  - **`colour:`** This argument decides the colour of the outline of the bars.
- The `labs` function is useful for adding titles and subtitles to your graph.
  

### Other Optional Arguments

Some optional arguments for the `geom_bar()` function include:

  - **`width:`** This argument changes the width of the bars, it defaults at 0.9.
  - **`alpha:`** Changes the transparency of the bars.


### Questions

For this module, we will be using lemur data from Alex Cookson, https://github.com/tacookson/data/tree/master/duke-lemur-center.

```{r read-data-bargraph, message=F}
animals <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/duke-lemur-center/animals.txt")
```

Let's start with plotting a simple bar chart of the sex of the animals in the dataset. We will see that R names the x and y axis but does not add a title.
```{r bar-chart-1, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

We can also change the colours of the inside of the bars, using the fill argument. If we set it equal to green, we will get green bars.
```{r bar-chart-fill, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "green")
```

Similarly, we can also change the colour of the outline of the bars. If we set it to red, the outline of the bars will be red.
```{r bar-chart-colour, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(colour = "red")
```

Both the fill and colour arguments can be combined in the same call of the `geom_bar()` function

```{r bar-chart-fill-col, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "white", colour = "red")
```

You can also change the colour/fill by adding the argument to the `aes()` expression. Doing this will give a specific colour for each value in your fill variable.
```{r bar-chart-fill-aes, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex, fill = birth_type)) +
  geom_bar(colour = "black")
```

#### Optional Arguments

Using the same data, we can change the width of the bars. Using a width greater than 0.9 will make the bars wider, and using a width smaller than 0.9 will make them thinner.

```{r bar-chart-width, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "white", colour = "red", 
           width = 1) 
```

#### Adding labels to your bar charts

The `labs` function helps add labels such as titles, subtitles, and labels for the x and y axis.
```{r bar-chart-title, exercise = T}
animals %>% ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "white", colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "My bar chart's title",
       subtitle = "Using animal data",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Count")
```

For the most part, you won't really need to change the y-axis as it just gives the count, but make sure to change the x-axis if it is a confusing variable name.

#### Plotting numeric variables

You can still create bar charts using numeric variables, provided that there aren't too many different numbers present.

```{r bar-chart-numeric, warning=F, exercise = T}
animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = litter_size)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Litter Sizes",
       x = "Litter Size")
```

#### Rotating your bar chart

The `coord_flip` function works to rotate the bar chart, giving a different view of the data. It also helps display the labels on the x-axis if they are overlapped. For this example, we can rotate the graph that was plotted above.

```{r bar-graph-coord-flip, warning=F, exercise = T}
animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = litter_size)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Litter Sizes",
       x = "Litter Size") +
  coord_flip()
```


### Exercises

#### Plot a Simple Bar Chart

Create a bar chart of the type of birth for the lemurs in the `animals` dataset. (Hint: the variable for type of birth is `birth_type`)
```{r bar-chart-q1, exercise = TRUE}
## Enter code below
animals
```

```{r bar-chart-q1-solution}

animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = birth_type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

#### Making your bar chart a little more interesting

For this exercise, pick any colour to fill the bars of the bar chart and another colour for the outline. This time, plot the different types of species present in the dataset (don't worry about the labels overlapping, we'll address that later.)
```{r bar-chart-q2, exercise = TRUE}
## Enter code below, choose any colour you want

```

```{r bar-chart-q2-solution}

animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", colour = "green")
```

Since there were so many unique names in the species variable, it causes the x-axis labels to overlap. We can fix this using `coord_flip`, try it out for yourself! Plot the same graph as above, but use the `coord_flip` function

```{r bar-chart-q2-2, exercise = TRUE}
## Enter solution below

```

```{r bar-chart-q2-2-solution}

animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "blue", colour = "green") + 
  coord_flip()
```

#### Using the `aes()` fill option

For this exercise, plot the distribution of species of Lemur present in the dataset. Then, fill each bar depending on the sex of the lemur.
```{r bar-chart-q3, exercise = TRUE}

animals %>% 
```

```{r bar-chart-q3-solution}

animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
```

#### Check your understanding

The next questions will focus on the plot below

```{r bar-chart-quiz, echo=FALSE}
animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxonomic_code)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Taxonomic Codes",
       x = "Taxonomic Code")
```

```{r bar-chart-quiz-1, echo=FALSE}
question("Select the functions that it looks like were used to make this bar chart.",
         answer("ggplot", correct = T),
         answer("coord_flip", correct = T),
         answer("geom_bar", correct = T),
         answer("geom_point", correct = F),
         allow_retry = T)
```

```{r bar-chart-quiz-2, echo=FALSE}
question("If I wanted to change the colour of the **inside** of the bars, which argument would I need to use?",
         answer("fill = colour", correct = T),
         answer("colour = colour", correct = F),
         answer("inside = colour", correct = F),
         answer("bar_colour = colour", correct = F),
         allow_retry = T)
```

```{r bar-chart-quiz-3, echo=FALSE}
question("What code chunk would make a plot identical to the plot above. (Feel free to copy these into your own R file)",
  answer("animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(taxonomic_code)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Taxonomic Codes',
       x = 'Taxonomic Code')", correct = F),
  answer("animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(taxonomic_code)) +
  geom_bar()", correct = FALSE),
  answer("animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(taxonomic_code)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Taxonomic Codes',
       x = 'Taxonomic Code')", correct = T),
  answer("animals %>% 
  ggplot(aes(taxonomic_code)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()", correct = FALSE),
         allow_retry = T)
```


### Common Mistakes & Errors

- If the outline for graphs shows up but there are no bars present, it likely occurred because you didn't add `geom_bar` to your expression.
  
- If your labels appear to overlap, you can try using `coord_flip` to space them out a bit. If that doesn't work, you can add the `theme` function and change the size, and angle of the text. For example, `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))` puts the text at a 90 degree angle.

- When connecting `ggplot` to `geom_bar` make sure you use a plus sign (+) instead of the pipe operator. 

- If you get an error saying "object not found", it means that you may have missed a quotation mark around a colour or made a typo when referencing a variable.

## Histograms

Written by Haoluan Chen.


### Introduction

![Image Source:https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/ggplot2_exploratory.png, Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/master/rstats-artwork/ggplot2_exploratory.png?raw=true){width=400 height=300}

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Create a histogram in R using ggplot2 package

- Customize your histogram

Prerequisite skills include:

- Install and load ggplot2 packages

- Basics of using ggplot2: e.g. `ggplot()`, `aes()`.

Highlights:

- Create a histogram with a real dataset

### Making and customizing histograms

#### What is a histogram?

A histogram is a visual representation of the distribution of numerical data. It allows you to easily see where your data is concentrated and the variation of the data. It can help visually answer questions like:

* what values in the dataset appear most often?
* what is the range of values found in my data?

Here, we have a book dataset from Alex Cookson. This dataset contains 9,000 children's books that have been rated from 1-5 stars. 

```{r data, echo = T, result = 'hide'}
books <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/childrens-book-ratings/childrens-books.txt")

```

We can see that `rating` is a numerical variable, so we can create a histogram to visualize the rating distribution. 

Using the following code, we can create our first and simplest histogram in R!

```{r simple}
books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

For the histogram it only requires one numeric variable as input (`rating` in this case). The function `geom_histogram()` automatically counts the number of numerical values that lie within specific ranges, called bins. Bins are defined by their lower bounds (inclusive); the upper bound is the lower bound of the next bin. 

Looking at the histogram above, we can see that the x-axis (`rating`) is divided into small blocks (bins) and the y-axis represents the number if observations lie within that block. The warning is telling you there is missing values in the rating. We can ignore this for now.


#### Other Optional Arguments

In the geom_histogram function, we can adjust our bins' size, titles of the histogram, and color of our histogram. 

##### Bin size

We can adjust the bin size of our histogram by setting the optional parameter binwidth. 

```{r bins}
books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

Here, I am setting the bin width equal to 1. This means that we divide the rating into bins of range 1. In this case, we have a bin with range [2.5,3.5), [3.5,4.5), and [4.5,5.5). Then, we count the number of ratings that lies within this range. From the above histogram, we can see that there is about 8000 books lies within the range of [3,4).

Without specifying the binwidth, geom_histogram will automatically find an optimal binwidth. 
 

##### Color and fill

```{r color}
books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(color ="red", fill = "light blue")
```

The color parameter specify the color of the boundary of each bin and the fill parameter specify the color of the bin. You can create change the color of your histogram to make more unique and appealing.

##### Title, and name of the axes

Using the `labs()` function in ggplot2 we can change the title and the name of the axes. 
```{r lables}
books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(color ="red", fill = "light blue") +
  labs(title = "A historgram of children's book rating", 
       x = "Book rating", y = "Number of books")
```

In the `labs()` function, `title` specifies the title of your plot, `x` specifies the name of the x-axis and `y` specifies the name of the y-axis.  


### Exercises

#### Exercise 1

Please create a histogram for the ratings of the books that are published in 2010
**Hint: `filter()` in `dplyr` package maybe helpful**

```{r ex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

#### Exercise 2

Please change the bin width of your histogram in Exercise 1 to 0.2
```{r ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

#### Exercise 3

Please change the colour and the fill of your histogram in Exercise 1 
You can choose any colour you like from this website: https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html
You may use the colour name or the Hex code provided in the website.

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```


#### Exercise 4

```{r, echo = FALSE}
books %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = 'light blue', fill = 'light blue')
```




```{r ex4, echo = FALSE}
question("Which of the following code can produce above histogram? (Try to run the code on your computer!)",
          answer("geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = 'light blue')"),
          answer("books %>% ggplot(aes(rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = 'light blue')"),
          answer("books %>% ggplot(aes(rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = 'light blue', fill = 'light blue')", correct = TRUE),
          answer("books %>% ggplot(aes(rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = 'light blue', fill = 'light blue')"),

### Common Mistakes & Errors

- Make sure your input variable is a numeric variable.
- Make sure you are using `+` to connect the `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`, not the pipe operator `%>%` 
- Check you have closed all the bracket

### Next Steps

For next step, you can customize your histogram with different colour, labels and change the line types. You can find examples in this website: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-histogram-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization

In this website https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/histogram.html, you can find different types of histogram you can make in R it has codes that you can follow along. On the main page, there are many other types of visual representations you can build in R, such as box plot and scatter plot:https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html 












## Scatter plots

Written by Haoluan Chen.


### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Create a scatter plot in R using ggplot2 package
- Customize your scatter plot

Prerequisite skills include:

- Install and load ggplot2 packages

- Basics of using ggplot2: e.g. `ggplot()`, `aes()`.

Highlights:

- Create and customize a scatter-plot


### The content

### What is a Scatter plot?

A scatter plot is a visual representation of two numerical variables. It allows you to see the correlation between the variables. 

Here, we have a dataset `mtcars` extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.

```{r scatter1}
head(mtcars)
```

`wt` is the weight (1000lbs), `mpg` is the miles per gallon for the car. Now we are interested in the relationship between these variables among 32 different cars.

Using the following code, we can create our basic scatter plot in R!

```{r scatter2}
# Basic scatter plot
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

In this plot, each dot shows one car's miles per gallon versus its weight. We can see a decreasing trend among the weight and the miles per gallon for the car.


### Arguments

### Basic scatter plot
- The size and the shape of points can be changed using the function geom_point() as follow :

geom_point(size, shape)

```{r scatter3}
# Change the point size
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(size=2)
# Change the point shape
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape=23)
```

From the above figures, we know that we can change different sizes and shapes by changing parameters in `geom_point()`.

- The size of the points can be controlled by the values of a continuous variable as in the example below.


`cyl` is the number of cylinders of the car.

```{r scatter4}
# Change the point size by the values of cyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size=cyl))
```

### Change the appearance of the point
We can also change the color of the border of the point and filling of the point using the function geom_point() as follow :

geom_point(color, fill)

```{r scatter5}
# change shape, color, size
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape=23, color="darkred",size=3)

# change shape, color, fill, size
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape=23, fill="blue", size=3)

```


### Scatter plots with multiple groups

We can also change the points, colors, and shapes based on a variable.
In the R code below, point shapes, colors, and sizes are controlled by the levels of the factor variable cyl :

**We are using as.factor here because cyl is a double data type in the dataset. Using as.factor() can transform cyl into factor data type**

```{r scatter6}
# Change point shapes by the levels of cyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=as.factor(cyl)))
# Change point shapes and colors
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=as.factor(cyl), color=cyl))
# change point shapes,  colors and sizes
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=as.factor(cyl), color=cyl, size=cyl))
```




### Exercises

### Exercise 1 

Create a scatter plot to see the correlation between the hp and wt in mtcars

```{r scatter7}
mtcars
```

```{r scatterplotex1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r scatterplotex1-solution}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(hp, wt)) + geom_point()
```

### Exercise 2
Set the size of the scatter plot in previous question to 5 

```{r scatterplotex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r scatterplotex2-solution}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(hp, wt)) + geom_point(size = 5)
```
### Exercise 3
Set the color of the scatter plot in previous question to blue

```{r scatterplotex3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r scatterplotex3-solution}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(hp, wt)) + geom_point(size = 5, col = "blue")
```

### Common Mistakes & Errors

- If you want to change the colors and shapes based on a variable in your dataset, make sure it is a factor type dataset
- connect ggplot() and geom_point() by using `+` not `%>%`


### Next Steps

You may use geom_smooth() function to add a regression line on your scatter plot to get a clear pattern of your data. 

```{r scatternext}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') 
```

## Various useful options

Written by Yena Joo.

### Introduction
We learned how to create plots so far, now we are going to learn how to apply some additional functions to the graph to give them some changes. Visualization plays a very important role when using data analysis results. 

In this lesson, you will learn how to:  

- facet plots  
- label plots  
- change colors of the plots  
- function `breaks_pretty()`  

Prerequisite skills include:  

- You should be familiar with `ggplot` now.  
- You also should be able to read and manipulate datasets.  

Highlights:  

- Everything about how to make plots prettier!!

#### Packages  
```{r, message = F}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```


### Faceting
Faceting allows you to construct multi-panel plots and monitor how the scales of one panel compare to the scales of another. Which means, it partitions a plot into multiple panels. Each panel shows a different subset of the data.  

In other words, it is sometimes necessary to create a graph for each group in data by splitting one plot into multiple plots. In this case, you can use the `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` functions. These functions have the advantage of noticing the distribution of data by group easily.  

There are two main functions for faceting :  

- `facet_grid()`: produces a 2d grid of panels defined by variables which form the rows and columns.  
- `facet_wrap()`:  "wraps" a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d.  

#### `facet_grid()`
facet_grid(x ~ y) will display x*y plots even if some plots are empty. This function defines the shape feature of the panel. When used with ggplot, the x-axis and y-axis are kept as they are, and displayed divided by the variables you specify inside the argument. For example, `facet_grid(. ~ Variable)` changes the plot vertically.  

##### Arguments 
```
facet_grid( rows = NULL, cols = NULL, scales = "fixed", space = "fixed", shrink = TRUE, labeller = "label_value", as.table = TRUE, switch = NULL, drop = TRUE, margins = FALSE, facets = NULL)
```  

- rows, cols: A set of variables quoted by `vars()`. It can also be displayed `(variable ~ variable)`.
- scales: scales shared across all facets. (`"fixed"`, `"free_x"`, `"free_y"`, `"free"`).  

For more information, click [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_grid.html).   

**Facet with one variable**  

Here, I am using a dataset that contains the information of members who climbed the mountain Himalaya. Let's say, I would like to see the distribution of the sex of the members.   
```{r  message = F, warning = F}
members <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-22/members.csv')
hist_p <- members %>% ggplot(aes(age)) + geom_histogram(fill = "light blue", bins = 10)

# Split in vertical direction
hist_p + facet_grid(sex ~ .)
# Split in horizontal direction
hist_p + facet_grid(. ~ sex)
```
  
Splitting in vertical direction can be done with putting whichever variable you want to facet on the left, `facet_grid(variable ~ .)`. Putting the variable on the right side would split horizontally.  


**Facet with two variables**   
You can also facet with two variables. Here, I will facet with variables `success` and `injured`. Since they are both type boolean, it would be better to label the categories using `labeller = label_both`. 
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
hist_p + facet_grid(success ~ injured, labeller=label_both)
```
 
 

#### `facet_wrap()`
`facet_wrap()` wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. It is easy to understand by comparing the distribution of data by group(category).  

This function partitions the plot based on a categorical variable, and according to the factor of this column, the plot for each group is divided into subplots.  

##### Arguments
```
facet_wrap(facets, nrow = NULL, ncol = NULL, scales = "fixed", shrink = TRUE, labeller = "label_value", as.table = TRUE, switch = NULL, drop = TRUE, dir = "h", strip.position = "top") 
```   

- facets: set of variables. defines faceting groups on the rows or columns dimension.  
- nrow, ncol: Number of rows and columns.  
- scales: Specifies whether the x-axis and y-axis of each subplot are fixed.  
Note that the column, which is passed to this function, must be a factor, discrete variable.  

Here is an [additional information on the arguments and examples](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/facet_wrap.html) you may find helpful.   

Facets can be placed side by side using the function facet_wrap() as follows:  
```{r message = F, warning = F}
hist_p + facet_wrap(~ sex, nrow = 3, ncol=3)
```
  
`facet_wrap(x ~ y)`displays only the plots having actual values. The function displays plots for every combination of the selected variables.  

However, so far we don't see much of a difference between `facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()`, since the selected data is simple. Let's try to use a rather complex plot to see the difference between the two functions.  

#### `facet_grid()` vs `facet_wrap()`

We will use a built-in dataset `mpg`. First, create a scatter plot with variables `hwy` and `displ`. Then, I will use the variable `manufacturer` to facet the plot, using both `facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()`.  

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy, displ)) + geom_point()
p + facet_wrap(vars(manufacturer))
p + facet_grid(vars(manufacturer))
```
  
Now you can clearly see the difference between the two functions with the default arguments.   

### Labelling ggplot

ggplots can be labeled using `labs()`as follow:
```{r}
japanese_blooming <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/sakura-flowering/temperatures-modern.csv")
japanese_blooming %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_temp_c)) + geom_histogram(fill = "pink", bins = 20) + 
  labs(title = "This is a title",
  subtitle = "This is a subtitle",
  caption = "This is a caption",
  tag = "This is a tag", 
  x = "This is a x-axis label",
  y= "This is an y-axis label")
```
 
#### Arguments for `labs()`

- title: The text for the title.  
- subtitle: The text for the subtitle for the plot which will be displayed below the title.  
- caption: The text for the caption which will be displayed in the bottom-right of the plot by default.  
- tag: The text for the tag label which will be displayed at the top-left of the plot by default.  
- label: The title of the respective axis (for xlab() or ylab()) or of the plot (for ggtitle()).  
- x: x-axis label  
- y: y-axis label  

#### Labeling without using `labs()`  

- `xlab()` and `ylab()` adds the x-axis and y-axis labels.  
- `ggtitle("title", subtitle = "subtitle")` adds a title and a subtitle.

```{r}
japanese_blooming %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mean_temp_c)) + geom_histogram(fill = "pink", bins = 20) + 
  xlab("another way to add x-axis label") + 
  ylab("another way to add y-axis label") + 
  ggtitle("Another way to add a title", subtitle = "Another way to add a subtitle")
```



### How to change colors of ggplot

#### Change to a single color
For plots such as boxplots and histogram, you can choose what color you want to "fill" and what color you want as an outline of the graph. When making ggplots, you just add `geom_PLOTTYPE(fill = "color", color = "color")`.
```{r}
# box plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(group=vs, y=wt)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill='pink', color="red")
# scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color="dark red")
```

#### Change color by groups
Also, you can set the color by groups of variable. It automatically sets up a legend of changing colors depending on the variable value, using `fill` or `color` `= VARIABLE NAME`. 
```{r}
# Box plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(group = vs, y = wt, fill = vs)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point()
```


#### basic theme changing
`theme_gray` : gray background color and white grid lines   
`theme_bw` : white background and gray grid lines   
`theme_linedraw` : black lines around the plot  
`theme_dark()`: Dark background designed to make colours pop out  

*Note that, the function theme_set() changes the theme for the entire session.*   
(The detailed information of the basic theme changing can be found [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements)

### `pretty_breaks()` or `breaks_pretty()` 
`breaks_pretty()` uses default R break algorithm as implemented in pretty(). This is used often for splitting date/times. For example, when you want to divide 24 hours into 10 blocks, you would use the function `breaks_pretty` to split the time. 

```{r, eval = F}
pretty_breaks(n = 5, ...)
breaks_pretty()
```

Important argument:  

- n: desired number of breaks   
- [other arguments](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/pretty) passed on `pretty`   

Here is an example of using the function:  
  
Inside the parameter, you put the desired number of breaks. However, you may get slightly more or less breaks than what you put. 
For example, I can request to break number from 1 to 10 into 5 parts. 
```{r}
a <- breaks_pretty(n = 5)(1:10)
a
```
Then it returns 6 parts, which is slightly more than what I requested in the argument.  

Another example is to break dates into multiple parts using `as.Date()`.
```{r}
b <- pretty_breaks(n = 12)(as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2021-01-01")))
b
```  

This would automatically return the broken down scale of the date for you.  

These are the basics of the function `breaks_pretty()` or `pretty_breaks()` (they are interchangeable). If you would like to learn more about how to use these scales in a graph and visualize them, the information could be found [here](https://bookdown.org/Maxine/ggplot2-maps/posts/2019-11-27-using-scales-package-to-modify-ggplot2-scale/)


### Exercises

#### Question 1
using `facet_grid()`, divide the plot below by variable `vs`. 
```{r q1_usefuloptions, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(y = mpg, x = cyl)) + geom_point()
```

```{r q1_usefuloptions-solution}
plot <- mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(y = mpg, x = cyl)) + geom_point()
plot + facet_grid(vs ~ .)
```


#### Question 2
Label the following graph. Title should be 'scatter plot of mtcars', x-axis should be 'wt' and y-axis should be 'mpg'. 
```{r q2_usefuloptions, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point()
``` 

```{r q2_usefuloptions-solution}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = mpg)) + geom_point()
```

#### Question 3
Change the color of the scatter plot to 'pink'. 
```{r, q3_usefuloptions, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```
```{r, q3_usefuloptions-solution}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'pink')
```


### Next Steps

Good visualizations can help the audience/readers remember the information or the message the plot contains. Try to make plots using useful options to make the graph readable & attractive.

## Saving graphs

Written by Yena Joo.


### Introduction
There are some situations where you may need pictures of the plots when writing on blogs or sending emails about the data you're analyzing. In that case, you would wonder how to save and upload the plots created in R.  

In this lesson, you will learn how to:  

- save graphs  
- change graph sizes  

Prerequisite skills include:  

- You should know how to create graphs using `plot()` or `ggplot()`  
- You should know the formats of the image (such as png, jpeg, pdf)  

Highlights:  

- jpeg, png, pdf  
- `ggsave()`  
- `unlink()`  


### Saving Graphs 

#### Save as Jpeg image
Set the file name for the plot you are going to save using the function `jpeg(file = filename.jpeg)`, if you want to save as jpeg image. 
We need to call the function `dev.off()` after plotting, which will return control to the screen.  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
jpeg(file="plot1.jpeg")
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color= wt)) + geom_point()
dev.off()
```


#### Save as png image
We can set the resolution we want using the `width` and `height` arguments.
We can also set the full local path of the file we want to save if we don’t want to save it in the current directory.  

You can save the file as png image by using the function `png(file = "filepath/filename.png")`. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
png(file = "plot2.png", width = 500, height = 300)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
dev.off()
```

#### Save as pdf file

To save a plot as pdf format, we do the following using `pdf(file = 'filename.pdf')`. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdf(file = "plot3.pdf", eval = FALSE)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
dev.off()
```


#### Delete the saved image/file
What if we want to delete the file from the directory? We can delete the file using the function `base::unlink('FILE NAME')`. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
unlink("plot3.pdf")
```

#### `ggsave()`

Instead of using dev.off(), there is another function we can use to save the created plots. We use `ggsave()` to the ggplots.  

`ggsave()` includes the following arguments:  
```
ggsave(filename, plot = last_plot(), device = NULL, path = NULL, scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, units = c("in", "cm", "mm"), dpi = 300, limitsize = TRUE, ...)
```   
And these are some core arguments:  

- `filename`: file name of the graph you are going to save.  
- `plot`: By default, the plot to save is the last plot displayed on your R file.  
- path: path of the directory to save the plot. By default, it is directed to the working directory.  
- `width`, `height`, `units`: You can set the width and height, as well as the units of those measurements.  

Here are some examples. Make sure put the correct format of the file after the file name as follows: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
ggsave("plot4.pdf")
ggsave("plot4.png")
ggsave("plot4.jpeg")
ggsave("mtcars.pdf", width = 20, height = 20, units = "cm")
```

If you would like to delete the file, you can use the same `unlink()` function.  

### Exercises

#### Question 1
Modify this code so you can save the following scatter plot into 10 x 10 cm graph in jpeg format, using `ggsave`. The file name should be `answer1`. 
```{r q1_save, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
```

```{r q1_save-solution}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
ggsave("answer1.jpeg", width = 10, height = 10, units = "cm")
```

#### Question 2
Now, delete the file using `unlink`. 
```{r q2_save, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r q2_save-solution}
unlink("answer1.jpeg")
```


#### Question 3
Now, using `dev.off()`, save the following plot as pdf. The name of the file should be ```iloveplot.pdf```. 
```{r q3_save, exercise.eval = TRUE, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color= wt)) + geom_point()
```

```{r q3_save-solution}
jpeg(file="iloveplot.pdf")
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color= wt)) + geom_point()
dev.off()
```


### Next Steps

#### Common Mistakes & Errors
- Be careful when you set the local file path. 


#### Next Steps
- You can use the saved graph in your documents such as word, pptx, or even post the pictures online.
