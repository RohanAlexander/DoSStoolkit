## Introduction

Written by Rohan Alexander.

In this module, we are going to explore data in R. R is a fully-featured programming language. However, it was developed to be a statistical programming language. This means that it was built to deal with data.

It has a lot of functionality built into it to deal with data, but it has also benefited from having a stable ecosystem of packages. These have enhanced what we think of as data and now that not only means numbers, but also letter, words, and language more generally, images, even video.

In this module we will cover an awful lot of content including:

- `head()`, `tail()`, `glimpse()`, and `summary()`, written by Haoluan Chen.
- `paste()`, `paste0()`, `glue::glue()` and `stringr`, written by Marija Pejcinovska
- `names()`, `rbind()` and `cbind()`, written by Isaac Ehrlich.
- `left_join()`, `anti_join()`, `full_join()`, etc, written by Haoluan Chen.
- Looking for missing data, written by Mariam Walaa.
- `set.seed()`, `runif()`, `rnorm()`, and `sample()`, written by Haoluan Chen.

There's a lot of data out there, and we've got the roos off the green. We can't wait to see what you do with it.

















## `head()`, `tail()`, `glimpse()`, and `summary()`

Written by Haoluan Chen.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Get an overview of your dataset using `head()`, `tail()`, `glimpse()`, and `summary()`

Prerequisite skills include:

- setup RStudio
- run R code in the console
- Install and load packages

Highlights:

- Using `head()`, `tail()`, `glance()`, and `summary()` to understand your dataset

After you load your dataset into R, you should start looking into the data to see what kinds of data you are working with.

Here are some useful functions that can help you to understand your dataset. 


### `head()`

The `head()` function takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the data frame, and the second parameter is the first number of rows you want to look at. (The "head" of your dataset.)

```{r headex}
head(mtcars, n = 3)
```

Here I have set 'n' to 3, so we are looking at the first three rows of the mtcars dataset. 



### `tail()`

The `tail()` function also takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the data frame, and the second parameter is the last number of rows you want to look at. (The "tail" of your dataset.)


```{r tailex}
tail(mtcars, n = 3)
```

Here I have set 'n' to 3, so we are looking at the last three row of the mtcars dataset. 

### `glimpse()`

The `glimpse()` function takes in one parameter, which is the data frame. This function can tell you the number of rows and columns for your dataset. Additionally, you can get the name, data type, and first few observations of each variable.  

```{r glimpseex}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

Here, we see that the table mtcars contains 32 rows and 11 columns of data. All of the variables in this table are double-precision floating-point number, because <dbl> represents the double data type.

### `summary()`

Next, you may want to look at the summary statistics of your data set. The function summary can produce the following summary statistics for each of the variables. 

- Min. : minimum value of the variable 
- 1st.Qu. : the first quartile of the variable
- Median: median of the variable
- Mean: mean of the variable
- 3rd Qu. : the third quartile of the variable
- Max. maximum value of the variable


```{r sumex}
summary(mtcars)
```

What happens if you have other data types in your dataset? Here is a dataset called scores. It contains three variables student_ID, gender, and test_score. 


```{r sumex2}
scores <- tibble(student_ID = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"),
                 gender = as.factor(c("male", "male", "male","female","female","female")),
               test_score = c(87, 76, 61, 80, 72, 69),
               )
scores
```

```{r sumex3}
glimpse(scores)
```

Using the glimpse function, we know that student_ID is a character data type, gender is a factor data type, and test_score is a double data type.

```{r sumex4}
summary(scores)
```

For character data type (student_ID), we see the length, class, and Mode of this variable. Length tells us the number of observations, class, and Mode tells us the data type. 

For factor data type(gender), we have the count of each factor. In this dataset, there are three female students and three male students. 

For double data type(test_score), we have the summary statistics as we have seen before. 

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1

```{r headex2, echo = FALSE}
question("If you want to look at the first 5 rows of the mtcars dataset, which code should you use?",
          answer("head(mtcars,3)", correct = TRUE),
          answer("tail(mtcars, 3)"),
          answer("glimpse(mtcars)"),
          answer("summary(mtcars)"),
          allow_retry = TRUE)

``` 

#### Exercise 2

```{r summaryex, echo = FALSE}
question("What is the output of summary() function for factor data type?",
          answer("Summary statistics such as min and max"),
          answer("Data type"),
          answer("Count of each factor", correct = TRUE),
          answer("Number of factors in the variable"),
          allow_retry = TRUE)

``` 

#### Exercise 3

Here, we have a book dataset from Alex Cookson. This dataset contains 9,000 children's books that have been rated from 1-5 stars. Run the following code to your R and use the functions you learned in this tutorial to explore this dataset!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
books <- 
  read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/childrens-book-ratings/childrens-books.txt")
```


### Next Steps

Once you have fully understood the dataset you are working with you may start using plots to get a graphical representation of your dataset. You may like to read this chapter for more information: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html.














## `paste()`, `paste0()`, `glue::glue()` and `stringr`

Written by Marija Pejcinovska


### Introduction  

In this lesson we'll cover a couple of ways in which you can paste strings to your data. We'll use the `paste()` and `paste0()` functions, both of which are part of base R,  as well as the `glue()` function in the `glue` package. As part of this tutorial, you will also get a first taste of the `stringr` package, which is a wonderful tool for handling strings.  

Prerequisite skills:

- Exposure to most of the material in the yellow-level tutorials would be helpful.



### Paste strings and data with `paste()` and `paste0()`

`paste()` and `paste0()` are handy R functions used for concatenating strings and/or data. One of the main difference between the two is the default setting in their arguments, specifically the argument used to denote the way in which results should be separated. Both `paste()` and `paste0()` convert all passed objects to character vectors.   

Both functions have the following two arguments: `sep = ` and `collapse = `.

Let's see `paste()` in action first.   

You can pass individual objects to `paste()`
```{r}

paste(1, "a", "b")

```
 or pass vectors.
```{r}
paste(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```
Notice that when the arguments passed are vectors, the concatenation happens term-by-term. Vector arguments are recycled as necessary.  
For instance, note the difference between
```{r}
paste(1:2, "a", "b", "c")
```
and 
```{r}
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"))
```
You can see that in the latter example the concatenation is term-by-term and the sequence `1:2` is getting recycled (i.e. restarted) to match the length of `c("a", "b", "c")`.  

The argument `sep = ` in the function controls which character string is used to separate the terms. By default, the `paste()` function sets `sep = " "`, meaning concatenated terms are separated by empty space. We can set the separator to be any string character we'd like. 

```{r}
### Leaving no space
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "")

### Concatenating with a dash
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "-")

### Concatenating with a random letter
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "Y")

##..and so on
```

If a value is specified for the argument `collapse = `, the elements in the result are then turned into a single string, with the components being separated by the character string provided in `collapse`. For instance, we can turn 
```{r}
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "-")
```
into a single string as
```{r}
paste(1:2, c("a", "b", "c"), sep = "-", collapse = ", ")
```

where we've used `,  ` ` ` (comma with a blank space) as a separator.

The most preferred separator tends to be the "no space" one. This is the default setting of `paste0`.

Run the following code to see the difference between `paste` and `paste0`

```{r ex1_paste_, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}

paste("I", "Love", "R","!")

paste0("I", "Love", "R", "!")


```

Of course, you might be interested in a more sophisticated collection of objects to paste. For instance, suppose you needed to work with a combination of character strings and existing R objects.

```{r student-example-paste}
student <- c("Rohan", "Monica")
badges <- c(2,4)
term <- c("Fall", "Spring")

paste(student, "collected", badges, "DoSS toolkit badges in the", term )

```


### "Gluing" your data with the `glue` package

The `glue` package is designed to make it easier to "stitch" or interpolate (or "glue") your data into strings. Its main function is quite similar in flavor to `paste()` (and `paste0()`), but a bit easier to use (this is especially true when compared to `sprintf()`; a function that we have not discussed here, but can similarly be used to concatenate strings and data).  

You can download `glue` the usual way you would install all your other packages, that is, by calling `install.packages("glue")`.

#### The functions of `glue`
The glue package has three primary functions, `glue()`, `glue_data()` and `glue_collapse()`.   

The **`glue()` function** works a bit like the `paste()` function. In the case of `glue()`, however, we use `{}` to wrap the R code we wish to reference inside the string. This makes it a bit more manageable compared to all the quotation marks, commas, and separators we need to keep track of when using `paste()`.

Let's refer back to our example from earlier and check out the syntax for `glue()`. Note that now everything is placed inside a single set of quotation marks and R objects are referenced within the string by wrapping them up in curly brackets. 

```{r student-example-glue}
student <- c("Rohan", "Monica")
badges <- c(2,4)
term <- c("Fall", "Spring")

glue("{student} collected {badges} DoSS toolkit badges in {term}")

```

Here we've called the R objects `student`, `badges`, and `term` by wrapping them up in `{}`. 

If you wish to use something other than `{}`, you can specify different opening and closing delimiters by using the `.open = ` and `.close = ` arguments in the `glue` function. For instance, let's surround the code we wish to evaluate by `<` at the beginning and `]` at the end.

```{r student-example-glue2}
student <- c("Owen", "Monica")
badges <- c(2,4)
term <- c("Fall", "Spring")

glue("<student] collected <badges] DoSS toolkit badges in <term]", .open = "<", .close = "]")

```

The function **`glue_data()`** works much like `glue()` but it is designed to be used in piped chains (recall the pipe operator, ` %>% `). What's important to note here is that inside the curly braces we pass the column names of the columns in our data we wish to glue in some way (and not the name of the variables or R objects as we did with `glue()`). 

As an example run the following code. See what happens if you change `glue_data()` below with `glue()`.

```{r penguin-example-glue-data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=12}

library(palmerpenguins)
## Check the data out
penguins %>% 
  head()

## "Glue" some data elements together
penguins %>% 
  slice(1:4) %>% 
  glue_data("This {species} penguin living on {island} \\
            island has flipper length {flipper_length_mm} mm") 

## note: the "\\" symbol in the string code above is simply to force the string to appear as one line. 

```


Finally, the **`glue_collapse()` function** concatenates multiple values into one. This function has a particularly clever and useful argument called `last` which allows you to change the separator for the last value (a feature not available in `paste()`).

```{r}
glue_collapse({letters[1:3]}, sep = ", ", last = ", and ")

```


### First taste of the `stringr` package

As a budding data scientist, you may have discovered that data analysis tasks usually involve spending an outsize portion of your time cleaning and processing data (it's a very special tax you have to pay before you get to the "fun" data scienc-y bits and pieces!!).   

On occasion your data may contain lots of text or strings. The `stringr` package, which is part of the core *tidyverse*, is a wonderful collection of functions that make string manipulation easier.   

This section is intended to get you started with the `stringr` package and involves just a brief introduction to the `str_detect()` and `str_replace()` functions in `stringr`.   

All functions in this package begin with the `str_` prefix and have easy to remember, intuitive names. 

For instance, `str_detect()` allows you to check whether a vector of characters contains a particular pattern, in other words, it allows you to *detect* a pattern in a string. The function returns a logical vector of the same length as the input, where `TRUE` indicates the pattern has been matched in that index. 

Let's check this out.
```{r str-detect-1}

my_vec <- c("r", "R", "I love R", "why?", "what is this?")

my_vec %>% 
  str_detect("r")

my_vec %>% 
  str_detect("wh")
```

Note that the pattern detection is case sensitive. 

`str_replace()`, on the other hand, allows you to replace a matched pattern with an entirely new string (or an empty string, if what you  wish to do is remove the pattern; see also `str_remove()`). 
```{r str-remove-1}
my_vec 

my_vec %>% 
  str_replace("\\?", " code")

```

The first argument is the pattern we are trying to find a match for (note that since ? is a special character we need to escape it by placing `\\` before `?`). The second argument here is the string we wish to replace our matched pattern with (in our case that's the string "code"). 

Let's see the `str_replace()` function applied to our penguins data. We'll use the function to slightly modify the name of an island

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  slice(1:4) %>% 
  mutate(new_island = str_replace(island, "Tor", "Mor"))
  
```


This is just a small slice of what the `stringr` package has to offer. Be on the lookout for future tutorials with more on strings and regular expressions. 


### Exercises


Consider the first few rows of the penguin data we saw in an example earlier. For this exercise we'll call the sliced data `small-penguins`. To refresh your memory of what the data frame looks like it's been reproduced here (use the arrows to navigate left and right through the columns). 

```{r small_penguins, echo=TRUE}
small_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  slice(1:10)
small_penguins
```



```{r small_penguins0, echo=TRUE}
small_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  slice(1:7)
small_penguins
```

#### Exercise 1

Use an appropriate function from the `glue` package to produce the following string "This penguin is of the species XXX from island XXX and has body mass of XXX g" describing the 6th penguin in `small_penguins`, where the three XXX should be species, island name, and body mass respectively.


```{r ex1_glue_data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.setup = "small_penguins"}

small_penguins %>% 

  

```

```{r ex1_glue_data-solution}

small_penguins %>% 
  slice(6) %>% 
  glue_data("This penguin is of the species {species} from island {island} and has body mass of {body_mass_g} g" )
  
```



#### Exercise 2

Using `glue()` and `glue_collapse()` manipulate the vectors `quant` and `food` below to get the following single string "1 sushi roll, 2 tacos, and 3 cakes"

```{r ex2_glue_collapse, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.eval=FALSE}

quant <- 1:3
food <- c("sushi roll", "tacos", "cakes")


```

```{r ex2_glue_collapse-solution}

quant <- 1:3
food <- c("sushi roll", "tacos", "cakes")

glue_collapse((glue("{quant} {food}")), sep = ", ", last = ", and ")

# Or alternatively with the piping syntax
glue("{quant} {food}") %>% 
  glue_collapse(.,sep = ", ", last = ", and")
  
```


#### Exercise 3 

Back to our `small_penguins` data from Exercise 1.

Use `str_detect()` and `filter()` to subset the `small_penguins` data to include only female penguins. 

```{r ex3_str-detect, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.setup = "small_penguins"}

small_penguins %>% 

  

```

```{r ex3_str-detect-solution}

small_penguins %>% 
  filter(str_detect(sex, "fe"))
  
```





#### Exercise 4

Use  `mutate()` to create a new variable `island_short` where with the help of `str_replace` you remove the pattern "ersen"  from the island name.

```{r ex4_str-remove, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.setup = "small_penguins"}

small_penguins %>% 

  

```

```{r ex4_str-remove-solution}

 small_penguins %>% 
  mutate(island_short = str_replace(island, pattern = "ersen", replacement = ""))

```




### Next Steps


- This tutorial only briefly introduced you to the capabilities of the `stringr` package. Future tutorials will revisit this package and dive deeper into some of its functions. In the meantime, you can learn more about this package in Hadley Wickham's book *"R for Data Science"*. The link here takes you to the chapter on strings which also introduces you to regular expressions (regular expressions are a bit tedious, but you might learn to like them if you end up working with text data a lot). https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html 











## `names()`, `rbind()` and `cbind()`

Written by Isaac Ehrlich.

### Introduction

For certain tasks, you may need to combine data frames and find information about them.

In this lesson, you will learn how to

* Use `names()` to find the column names of data frames
* Use `rbind()` to combine two or more data frames by row
* Use `cbind()` to combine two or more data frames by column

Prerequisites:

* Understanding how to data frames and their basic principles

### Arguments

#### `names()`

The primary purpose of `names()` is to return the column names of a data frame. The only argument that `names()` takes is the data frame.

```{r names-ex}
head(starwars)
names(starwars)
```

Using indexing, `names()` can also be used to change the column names of a data frame.

```{r}
# Change the tenth column name to home-planet
names(starwars)[10] <- "home-planet"
names(starwars)
```

#### `rbind()`

The purpose of `rbind()` is to combine two (or more) data frames by row. The arguments to `rbind()` are two (or more) data frames. These data frames must have the same number of columns, and must have the same column names as well.
```{r}
letter_df <- data.frame(numbers = 1:26, strings = letters)
words_df <- data.frame(numbers = 27:1006, strings = words)

character_df <- rbind(letter_df, words_df)
names(character_df)
dim(character_df) # shows the number of rows and columns

```

#### `cbind()`

The purpose of `cbind()` is to combine two (or more) data frames by column. The arguments to `cbind()` are two (or more) data frames. These data frames must have the same number of rows, or the number of rows must be multiples of one another. Note, in the case that the number of rows are multiples, the rows in the smaller data frame are repeated so they match the longer data frame.
```{r}
index_df <- data.frame(numbers = 1:5, letters = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
names_df <- data.frame(vegetables = c("arugula", "broccoli", "cauliflower", "dill", "endive"),
                       fruits = c("apricot", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"),
                       flowers = c("aster", "begonia", "crocus", "daffodil", "echium"))

combined_df <- cbind(index_df, names_df)
names(combined_df)
dim(combined_df) # shows the number of rows and columns

```


### Questions and Exercises

#### Question 1

Using the `presidential` data frame, save the column names, and then change the name of the second column to `inauguration-date`.

```{r names-q1, echo = FALSE, exercise = TRUE}
# Enter your code below

# Save column names
presidential_col_names <- 
presidential_col_names
  

# Change the second column name


# Finally, print out the new column names
names(presidential)
```

```{r names-q1-solution}
presidential_col_names <- names(presidential)

names(presidential)[2] <- "inauguration-date"
```


#### Question 2

```{r rbind-q2, echo = FALSE}
question("If you were to rbind() a data frame to itself, ",
answer("the number of columns would double"),
answer("the number of rows would double", correct = TRUE),
answer("both the number of rows and the number of columns would double"),
allow_retry = TRUE)
```

#### Question 3

```{r rbind-q3, echo = FALSE}
question("Select the following true statements about rbind() arguments",
answer("The data frames must have the same number of columns", correct = TRUE),
answer("The data frames must have the same number of rows"),
answer("The column names of the data frames must be the same", correct = TRUE),
answer("The data frames must have the same name"),
allow_retry = TRUE)
```

#### Question 4

Bind the `presidential` data set to itself using `rbind()`.

```{r rbind-q4, echo = FALSE, exercise = TRUE}
# Enter your code below

double_presidential <- 
  
dim(presidential)  
dim(double_presidential)
```

```{r rbind-q4-solution}
double_presidential <- rbind(presidential, presidential)
```


#### Question 5

```{r cbind-q5, echo = FALSE}
question("If you were to cbind() a data frame to itself, ",
answer("the number of columns would double", correct = TRUE),
answer("the number of rows would double"),
answer("both the number of rows and the number of columns would double"),
allow_retry = TRUE)
```

#### Question 6

Bind the `presidential` data set to itself using `cbind()`.

```{r cbind-q6, echo = FALSE, exercise = TRUE}
# Enter your code below

double_presidential <- 
  
dim(presidential)  
dim(double_presidential)
```

```{r cbind-q6-solution}
double_presidential <- cbind(presidential, presidential)
```

### Special Cases & Common Mistakes

The most common error with `rbind()` and `cbind()` occurs when the data frames do not meet the requirements (e.g. data frames have different number of columns for `rbind()` or different number of rows for `cbind()`). These will result in error messages such as "numbers of columns of arguments do not match" or "arguments imply differing number of rows". 

Similarly, if the names of the columns do not match, `rbind()` will give a "names do not match previous names" error. You can use `names()` to check against this error.


### Overview & Next Steps

`names()` will return the column names of data frames and can be used to change column names as well. `rbind()` and `cbind()` combine data frames either by row or by column.

In the next section, we will continue learning how to manipulate data frames.












## `left_join()`, `anti_join()`, `full_join()`, etc

Written by Haoluan Chen.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Join two tables by using `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, `inner_join` and `anti_join()`

Prerequisite skills include:

- Install and load dplyr package

Highlights:

- Learn how two join two tables  

Sometimes you may want to combine two data frames into a single table. Here we have one table which contains data such as the student id and their grade. And we have another table that includes demographic information about the student.

```{r joindata}
test_score <- tribble(~student_id, ~grade
                  ,'1',  94
                  ,'2',  90
                  ,'3',  88
                  ,'4',  75
                  ,'5',  66
                  )
student_info <- tribble(~student_id, ~age,~gender
                  ,'1', 18, 'F'
                  ,'2', 20, 'F'
                  ,'4', 25, 'M'
                  ,'6', 21, 'M'
                  ,'7', 23, 'F'
                  )
test_score
student_info
```

Using `dplyr` within R, we can easily import our data and join these tables, using the following join types.

- Left Join (`left_join()`)
- Right Join (`right_join()`)
- Full Join (`full_join()`)
- Inner Join (`inner_join()`)
- Anti Join (`anti_join()`)

The general syntax of these joins is as follows:

join_type(firstTable, secondTable, by=columnTojoinOn)

We'll now run through an example of using each of these join types on our two tables.


### `left_join()`

`left_join()` will take all of the values from the table we specify as left (e.g., the first one) and match them to records from the table on the right (e.g., the second one) by the variable we specified. If there is no match in the second table, it will show NULL for the values in the second table. For example, if we left joined 'test_score' to 'student_info', our data would look as follows:

```{r leftjoin}
leftJoinDf <- 
  left_join(test_score,student_info, by='student_id')

leftJoinDf
```


### `right_join()`

One of the easiest ways to consider a right join is the opposite of a left join! In this instance, the table specified second within the join statement will be the one that the new table takes all of its values from. If there is no match in the first table (the table specified first in the argument), it will return NULL for the values in the first table that did not find a match. In this instance, if we right joined student_info to test_score, our data would look as follows:

```{r rightjoin}
rightJoinDf <- right_join(test_score,student_info,by='student_id')
rightJoinDf
```

### `full_join()`

The full join returns all of the data in a new table, whether it matches on either the left or right tables. If the specified variable match on two tables, then a join will be executed. Otherwise, it will return NULL in places where a matching row does not exist.

```{r fulljoin}
FullJoinDf <- full_join(test_score,student_info,by='student_id')
FullJoinDf
```

### `inner_join()`

inner_join creates a new table that only contains matched rows in both tables. 
For example, if we decided to join by student_id, the new table would contain rows 1 and 2:

```{r innerjoin}
InnerJoinDf <- inner_join(test_score,student_info,by='student_id')
InnerJoinDf
```

### `anti_join()`

An anti join will return all of the rows from the first table where there are no matching values from the second.

An example of this is shown below:

```{r antijoin}
AntiJoinDf <- anti_join(test_score,student_info,by='student_id')
AntiJoinDf
```

### Common Mistakes & Errors

- Make sure there is at least one common variable in the tables you are joining.
- Think about how you want to join the table and use the appropriate join function.

### Next Steps

You can read through R for Data Science Chapter 13 Relational(working with multiple tables) data (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) for a more detailed explanation and visualization.

## Looking for missing data

Written by Mariam Walaa.


### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Find implicit missing data

Prerequisite skills include:

- Using the pipe operator %>%

Highlights:

- Use complete() and fill() to find implicit missing data

### Overview

In applied statistics, when we think of looking for missing data, the first thought that
may come to mind is that we are looking for NA values in the data set. However, that is
not the only type of missing data that we may have. We may also want to ask ourselves: Are
there missing _variables_ in the data? Are there missing _observations_ in the data?

These may be difficult questions to ask, especially if we do not know what our data
represents well. A simpler question that we may ask, however, is: does our data set
contain all possible combinations of some collection of variables?

While that may be a more directly answerable questionable, it is still difficult to try to
understand what exactly this may mean. Let's try to break this down using some concrete,
hypothetical data.

Suppose we have a data set representing student grades for a collection of required first
year courses for the statistics major: STA130, CSC108, MAT137, at the end of their first
year. However, some students have not finished all three courses and may be taking some in
the summer.

Let's start by loading the tidyverse.

```{r missing-data-1}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here is our hypothetical data.

```{r missing-data-2, include = FALSE}
first_year <- tibble(student_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6),
                     course = c("STA130", "CSC108", "MAT137",
                                "STA130", "CSC108", "STA130",
                                "STA130", "CSC108", "MAT137",
                                "STA130", "MAT137", "MAT137"),
                     grade = round(rnorm(n = 12, mean = 80, sd = 4)))
```

```{r missing-data-3}
first_year
```

As you can see, our data is missing some rows that would correspond to courses that 
students have yet to complete.

Suppose, for some reason, that you want to count the number of courses that are left
for all students to take until they have completed all their requirements, or maybe you
want to try predicting the grades a student will get on their remaining courses.

Regardless, you will need to "manipulate" this data set to make it so that you can see
which courses students have yet to complete.

The `complete()` function is the right tool to do this. We can do this as follows.

```{r missing-data-4, include = FALSE}
first_year %>%
  complete(student_id, course)
```
```{r missing-data-4-flair, echo = FALSE}
decorate("missing-data-4") %>%
  flair("complete", color = "hotpink") %>%
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

This function gives us rows that represent courses students still haven't completed,
which we don't have their grades for.

### Arguments

### complete()

The `complete()` function takes the following as arguments:

| Argument | Parameter        | Details                                           |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| data     | input data frame | data whose columns we'll use to find missing data |
| …        | vector           | columns to find and complete all combinations for |
| fill     | named list       | values to fill the cells for newly added rows     |

You can read more about the arguments in the `complete()` function's reference
[here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/complete.html) or with `?complete`.

### fill()

The `fill()` function takes the following as arguments:

| Argument   | Parameter        | Details                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| data       | input data frame | dataframe whose columns we use to fill missing data   |
| …          | vector           | columns to find and complete all combinations for     |
| .direction | string           | 'up', 'down', 'downup' for direction to fill values   |

You can read more about the arguments in the `fill()` function's reference
[here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/fill.html) or with `?fill`.

### Exercises

There are many ways to fill the data we got above. If, for some reason, we wanted to fill
it based on the past or the next value, we can use the fill() function. If, however, we 
wanted to fill all the empty values with a specific number, we could use the 'fill' 
parameter within the complete() function.

#### Exercise 1

Referencing the Arguments section, try to fill it based on the _past_ value using the
fill() function.

```{r missing-data-exercise-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r missing-data-exercise-1-sol, echo = FALSE}
missing_data_ex1_sol <- first_year %>%
  complete(student_id, course) %>%
  fill(grade, .direction = 'down')
```

```{r missing-data-exercise-1-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, missing_data_ex1_sol)))
```

#### Exercise 2

Referencing the Arguments section, try to fill all the empty values with a specific number
'0' using the 'fill' parameter within the complete() function.

```{r missing-data-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r missing-data-exercise-2-sol, echo = FALSE}
missing_data_ex2_sol <- first_year %>%
  complete(student_id, course, fill = list(grade = 0))
```

```{r missing-data-exercise-2-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, missing_data_ex2_sol)))
```

## `set.seed()`, `runif()`, `rnorm()`, and `sample()`

Written by Haoluan Chen.


### Introduction


In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Generate numbers from a uniform distribution or normal distribution 
- Sample from a collection of numbers

Prerequisite skills include:

- Run code in R
- Basic knowledge of uniform distribution and normal distribution and sampling

Highlights:

- Generate random value from a uniform distribution and normal distribution
- Generate random value from a set
- `set.seed()` for reproducibility 


### The content


Simulation is an important topic in statistics because it helps you understand how random data might be generated. For some experiments, you may want to simulate values from probability distributions. In R, we can use `runif()` and `rnorm()` function to generate random number from uniform distribution or normal distributionr. Also, we can randomly sample from a set of numbers by using the `sample()` function. 

#### runif()


The `runif()` function generate random numbers from a uniform distribution.  

##### Arguments

It takes in three parameters: `n`, `min` and `max`. The parameter `n` specifies the number of random values you want to generate. The parameter `min` and `max` specify the range of the uniform distribution. The default of min and max are 0 and 1.

Arguments | What does it mean
------------- | -------------
n (required) | number of random values you want to generate (numeric)
min (optional) | the minimum value of the uniform distribution you are sampling from (numeric)
max (optional)| the maximum value of the uniform distribution you are sampling from (numeric)


##### Example


```{r ex1}
runif(n = 3)
```
The above code means to generate three random numbers from unif(0,1) where unif is a uniform distribution with a minimum value of 0 and maximum value of 1.

What if you want to generate number from `unif(2,8)` uniformly?

In `runif()` function, we can specify the min and max to be 2 and 8 to generate three numbers from unif(2,8):

```{r ex2}
runif(n = 3, min = 2, max = 8)
```

#### rnorm()


In R, we can use `rnorm()` function to generate numbers from a normal distribution. 

##### Arguments

It takes in three parameters: `n`, `mean`, and `sd`. The parameter `n` specifies the number of random values you want to generate. The parameter `mean` and `sd` specifies the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution you wish to sample. The default of `mean` and `sd` are 0 and 1.

Arguments | What does it mean
------------- | -------------
n (required) | number of random values you want to generate (numeric)
mean (optional) | the mean value of the normal distribution you are sampling from (numeric)
sd (optional)| the standard deviation of the normal distribution you are sampling from (numeric)

##### Example

Let's say we want to generate 5 random number from a normal distribution with `mean = 0` and `sd = 2`.

```{r ex3}
rnorm(n = 5, sd = 2)
```

Here, we set the `n` to be 5 and `sd` to be 2, because we want to generate five random numbers from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 2. We do not have to specify the mean value here because the default of the mean parameter is 0, which is exactly what we want. 

What if we want to generate 5 number from normal(10,2)?

```{r ex4}
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 10, sd = 2)
```
Here, we generated 5 numbers from normal(10,2) distribution.

#### sample()

In R, we can using `sample()` to randomly sample numbers from a collection of numbers. 

##### Arguments

It takes in three parameters: x, size, and replace. The x is the vector of one or more elements that you wish to sample. The parameter size specifies the number of random values you want to generate. The parameter replace is a logical variable; true if you want to sample with replacement. 

When replace is set to true, you will be sampling from the same set of numbers for each generation. When replace is set to false, every time you sample a number, it will be taken out of the vector x for the next number generation. 

Arguments | What does it mean
------------- | -------------
x (required) | vector of one or more elements that you are sampling from
size (required) | number of random values you want to generate (numeric)
replace (optional)| true if you want to sample with replacement (logical)
prob (optional) | a vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the vector being sampled.

##### Examples


```{r ex5}

```

Here, we have a vector containing 6 numbers to simulate rolling dice. Let's roll the dice 6 times and see what we get:


```{r ex6}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
set.seed(2)
sample(x = x, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

**Don't worry about set.seed(1), you will learn in this tutorial!**
What if we set the replace to `FALSE`? 


```{r ex7}
set.seed(1)
sample(x = x, size = 6, replace = FALSE)
```

As we see that when `replace = TRUE`, we obtain repeated sample of 6 and 1. However, when `replace = FALSE`, there is no repeated sample in the output. 

When setting the replace to `FALSE`, the numbers are taken out for each round of sampling. Here, our first number is 5, which means that the second number will only be a sample from the set {2,3,4,5,6}. The 1 will be taken out of the vector for this sampling process. So, that is why we always get each number to appear once in the simulation.  

Using the prob argument, we can assign the probability of each elements the vector being sampled.
For example, for a unfair dice, The probability of getting a 6 is 40% and the probability of getting any other number are 12%. We may simulate this unfair dice using sample() function and setting the prob argument. 

```{r}
set.seed(2)
sample(x = x, size = 6, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.12, 0.4))
```



#### set.seed()


```{r undosetseed, include=FALSE}
set.seed(Sys.time())
```

Let's run our dice simulation twice and see what happens (run the following code twice)

```{r ex8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
sample(x = x, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

We get different results every time we run the simulation, because we randomly sampled from 1-6 with replacement. What if you want to reuse the result from one simulation? Sometimes you do not want your result to change every time you run the function. This is what `set.seed()` does. 

When you use `set.seed()` function before your simulation, the simulation output will be the same every time. 

##### Arguments


The `set.seed()` function takes in a number, and it can be any number.

##### Example


Let's use `set.seed()` before we do the dice simulation

Please run the following code twice. 

```{r ex9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
set.seed(2)
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
sample(x = x, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

This also works for `runif()`, `rnorm()` and other simulation functions. Once you use `set.seed()` your simulation will always produce the same result. 

### Exercises


#### Exercise 1


Please generate 10 random values from unif(-1,1) 

```{r exercise1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

#### Exercise 2

Please generate 10 random values from normal(0,5)
```{r exercise2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```


#### Exercise 3


```{r exercise3, echo = FALSE}
question("Which of the following code simulates rolling a fair dice 5 times?",
          answer("sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = TRUE)", correct = TRUE),
          answer("sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5, replace = FALSE)"),
          answer("sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 5)"),
          answer("runif(5, 1, 6)"),
          allow_retry = TRUE)

```

```{r exercise5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r exercise6}

```


#### Exercise 7


```{r exercise7, echo = FALSE}
question("How would you ensure that the simulations in Exercises 4 and 5 give the same result every time?",
          answer("You do not have to do anything, the simulation result will always be the same"),
          answer("Use set.seed() function before you run the simulation", correct = TRUE),
          answer("Set the set.seed parameter to TRUE"),
          answer("Use sample() function instead of rnorm"),
          allow_retry = TRUE)

```

### Common Mistakes & Errors


- Make sure you have input parameter in the right order!

### Next Steps


Sometimes you need to do additional things to make your simulated more similar to your data. You can take a look on this book: R Programming for Data Science: https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/simulation.html. It has videos that explains simulation concepts and simulating a linear model. 

You can also generate binomial random variables using `rbinom()`, and Poisson random variables using `rpois()`, among others!
















## Simulating datasets for regression

Written by Mariam Walaa.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Simulate data for regression 

Prerequisite skills include:

- Familiarity with `set.seed()`, `runif()`, `rnorm()`, `sample()` 

Highlights

- We can recover the linear regression model from simulated data

### Overview

In the previous section, we learned about how to simulate data. We can build
regression models from this simulated data. However, another thing we can do with these
functions is build simulated data _for_ regression models.

For example, suppose you were not given a data set but instead was told of the
distributions of some variables and given their coefficients for a linear regression
model. We can use this information to _create_ the simulated data.

### Idea
##### Written by Michael Chong

To simulate a data set, try writing it down on paper first, and then
think about which parts are random, then translate it to code! For example, if you think
some number $y$ is related *linearly* to $x$ with a slope of 0.3, with some random
measurement error, you could write it down on paper like this:

$$
y = 0.3\cdot x + error
$$

Translating it to code might look like:

```{r simulating-data-1}
x <- 2 # set some value of x
measurement_error <- rnorm(1) # normally distributed measurement error

y <- 0.3*x + rnorm(1) # calculate value of y
```

### Example

Suppose that, while looking at course evaluations and course averages, we have observed
that there may be some relationship between the course evaluation average and the overall
course average. While we dont have access to the full data corresponding to a course,
suppose we are given a *linear regression* for this data. I.e., we are given a slope and
intercept.

We want to use this information to simulate the data _from_ the linear regression.

Lets start with loading the tidyverse.

```{r simulating-data-2}
library(tidyverse)
```

We can simulate the data as follows.

```{r simulating-data-3, include = FALSE}
set.seed(2)

grading_trend <- tibble(course = sample(x = c("STA130", "CSC108", "MAT137"),
                                        size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        term = sample(x = c("F", "W", "S"), size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        course_avg = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 80, sd = 5),
                        error = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                        evaluations_avg = course_avg * 4.5 + error)
```
```{r simulating-data-4, echo = FALSE}
decorate("simulating-data-3") %>%
  flair("evaluations_avg = course_avg * 4.5 + error", color = "hotpink") %>%
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

Lets see what this relationship looks like visually, with the regression line.

```{r simulating-data-5}
grading_trend %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = course_avg, y = evaluations_avg)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = 'y ~ x')
```

We may use this data set to build a regression models using the `lm()` function as follows.

```{r simulating-data-6}
lm(evaluations_avg ~ course_avg, data = grading_trend)
```

As we expect, creating this linear regression model successfully recovers the original
slope of 4.5!

**Question**: Why might we want to do this? One reason may be
that we want to see how much we can vary our sample while maintaining that same regression
line (this may be referred to as slope sensitivity, according to [this blog
post](https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-simulation-to-understand-slope-sensitivity-ab6887d45fe1)).

Here is an illustration given three different samples generated to satisfy this regression line.

```{r simulating-data-7, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 10}
# Resource for code: https://www.tellingstorieswithdata.com/its-just-a-linear-model.html#overview

### Exercises

There are many functions involved when it comes to trying to simulate a data set. These
exercises will help you better learn which functions to use for which parts of the
simulation.

#### Exercise 1

When simulating a data set, you will likely need to work with various types of variables
-- continuous variables, discrete variables, numeric variables, and non-numeric variables.

When it comes to discrete variables (whether numeric, non-numeric, or a mix of both), you
will likely want to see a repetition of a finite set of values. There is a certain
function out of the handful of functions we learned about for simulating datasets that
will be helpful for this task.

For this exercise, youll try to simulate data points for a discrete variable representing
the number of times you might pick out a red ball from a jar full of blue, red, and yellow
balls. Suppose youll pick out a ball 10 times and put it back every time, and that each
ball has equal probability of being picked.

Fill in the blanks for the code below to create data that represents the above scenario.

```{r simulate-fill-in-sample, include = FALSE, results = FALSE}
sample(x = c("Red", "Blue", "Yellow"),
       size = 10,
       replace = TRUE,
       prob = c(0.33, 0.33, 0.33))
```
```{r simulate-fill-in-sample-1, echo = FALSE}
decorate("simulate-fill-in-sample") %>%
  mask("x") %>%
  mask("size") %>%
  mask("replace ") %>%
  mask("prob") %>%
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

Youll notice that there are 4 blanks in total that youll need to fill.

```{r simulate-fill-in-sample-2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(question("What should the first blank be?",
              answer("n"),
              answer("x", correct = TRUE),
              answer("c"),
              answer("size"),
              answer("replace"),
              answer("prob"),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question("What should the second blank be?",
              answer("n"),
              answer("x"),
              answer("c"),
              answer("size", correct = TRUE),
              answer("replace"),
              answer("prob"),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question("What should the third blank be?",
              answer("n"),
              answer("x"),
              answer("c"),
              answer("size"),
              answer("replace", correct = TRUE),
              answer("prob"),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question("What should the fourth blank be?",
              answer("n"),
              answer("x"),
              answer("c"),
              answer("size"),
              answer("replace"),
              answer("prob", correct = TRUE),
              random_answer_order = TRUE,
              allow_retry = TRUE))
```

#### Exercise 2

Suppose we are given a regression model with a slope of 4.5, and we want to simulate a 
dataset from the regression model with the previous scenario. What is wrong with this
data-generating code?

```{r simulate-data-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
set.seed(2)
grading_trend <- tibble(course = sample(x = c("STA130", "CSC109", "MAT137"),
                                        size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        term = sample(x = c("F", "W", "S"), size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        course_avg = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 80, sd = 5),
                        evaluations_avg = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 4, sd = 2))
```

```{r simulate-data-exercise-2-hint-1}
# It "works", in the sense that we get meaningful output, but it is not the output we want for this problem!
```
```{r simulate-data-exercise-2-hint-2}
# If you're really stuck, try looking at the code we used for this above, and determine what's different
```

```{r simulate-data-exercise-2-solution, exercise = FALSE}
set.seed(2)
grading_trend <- tibble(course = sample(x = c("STA130", "CSC109", "MAT137"),
                                        size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        term = sample(x = c("F", "W", "S"), size = 50, replace = TRUE),
                        course_avg = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 80, sd = 5),
                        error = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 0, sd = 1),
                        evaluations_avg = course_avg * 4.5 + error)
```

```{r simulate-data-exercise-2-code-check}
grade_code()
```

### Common Mistakes & Errors

Here are some common mistakes and errors you may come across:

- You may be confusing some of the arguments for different distribution functions. Make
sure youre using `runif()` to sample points from the _uniform_ distribution and `rnorm()`
to sample points from the _normal_ distribution.
- You may be misusing some of the arguments for a function like `sample()`. Make sure you
read the argument descriptions as well as the given examples in the documentation.
- You may forget to set the seed before running a chunk of code, or you may be using a
different value for a seed to obtain results you previously got with your code.

### Next Steps

If you would like to learn more about these functions, read the documentation associated
with each of the functions. But if you would like to learn more about simulating datasets
from a regression model, please take a look at the following:

## Advanced mutating and summarising

Written by Mariam Walaa.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Use across() with summarise()
- Apply conditions within summarise() and mutate() (_coming soon!_)

Prerequisite skills include:

- Familiarity with summarize().
- Familiarity with mutate().
- Familiarity with conditional statements (_coming soon!_).

Highlights:

- Use across() to summarize across a defined selection of columns
- Use summarize() and mutate() along with conditional statements (_coming soon!_)

### Overview

This section will demonstrate how to use the `summarise()` function with `across()` to 
summarize variables and groups within a variable in a data set.

We will be looking at a data set of Broadway shows with variables about the performances,
attendance, and revenue for theaters that are part of The Broadway League. You can learn
more about the data set provided by Alex Cookson in [the dataset
repository](https://github.com/tacookson/data) as well as this corresponding [blog
post](https://www.alexcookson.com/post/most-successful-broadway-show-of-all-time/).

#### Video

![](https://youtu.be/3mmbPjgzzeY)

### Questions

Lets start with loading the tidyverse and looking at the data.

```{r load-tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r across-2}
broadway
```

#### Question 1

What is the minimum and maximum number of performances _and_ previews per week?

Method: Use `across()` to select specific columns to summarize them with multiple
summary functions.

```{r across-3, include = FALSE}
broadway %>%
  group_by(week_ending) %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = c("performances", "previews"),
                   .fns = list(min = min, max = max)),
            .groups = 'drop')
```
```{r across-4, echo = FALSE}
decorate("across-3") %>%
  flair("across", color = "blue") %>%
  flair(".cols", color = "deeppink") %>%
  flair(".fns", color = "orange") %>%
  knit_print.with_flair()
```

Heres what this chunk of code does:

* Groups the data by week using `group_by()` 
* Selects columns to summarize by passing a vector to `.cols` in `across()` (Highlighted in pink) 
* Defines summary functions by passing a list to `.fns` in `across()` (Highlighted in orange)

You can learn more about `across()` by running `?across` in your console.

#### Question 2

How do we provide a numeric summary for every show happening in a particular week?

```{r across-5}
broadway %>%
  group_by(week_ending, show) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

This chunk of code summarizes every show happening in some particular week by every
numeric variable that is available in the data set. This helps us easily see things like
the average ticket price and the number of performances each show had in a particular
week.

### Arguments

The `across()` function takes the following as arguments:

| Argument | Parameter | Details                                           |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| .fns     |           | can pass a list of functions or a single function |
| .cols    | vector    | vector with column names to apply functions to    |

You can read more about the arguments in the `across()` functions documentation
[here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html). Note that the arguments for 
across() will depend on your use case.

#### Exercise

Count the number of distinct shows and distinct theatres using summarise() and across(). 

**Tip**: Try to use the data type for shows and theatres columns!

```{r across-exercise-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r across-exercise-1-sol, echo = FALSE}
across_ex1_sol <- broadway %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.character), n_distinct),
            .groups = 'drop')
```

```{r across-exercise-1-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, across_ex1_sol)))
```

## `forcats` and factors

Written by Matthew Wankiewicz.

```{r forcats-tidyverse, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r forcats-data-readin, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
expeditions <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/himalayan-expeditions/expeditions.csv")
```


### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about:

- Factors in R, how they work, what they do.
- The `forcats` package.

Highlights:

- Factors are a way of storing data in R. Instead of having many different combinations like a list of names or numbers, factors are usually created to represent a fixed number of values, such as levels (high, low, medium) or times (early, late, on-time). In other words, factors represent categorical data in R.
- `forcats` contains many functions that allow you to work with factors for plotting or further data analysis.


### The Content

Factors represent categorical variables in R. Factors are stored as integer levels in R, meaning that each level of a factor will be represented by an integer so R knows which one represents the maximum and minimum. Factors can be comprised of both integers and characters but the levels of these factors will be displayed as characters. The `factor` function can be used to create factors in R, it takes a vector of data and will turn it into a factor. This function can be used on columns in datasets to convert a column of data from numeric/character to a factor. 

`forcats` is a package that contains various functions to manipulate factors, it exists as its own package but is also included in the `tidyverse` package as well. The main goals of these functions are to help reorder and change factor levels, this is done by changing which levels appear at the front/back and also combining levels into other ones. 

A helpful cheatsheet for `forcats` can be found [here.](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/factors.pdf)

### Factors

The `factor` function allows you to take a vector and turn it into a factor. The vector used can be made up of characters or integers. Its main argument is the vector that you want to turn into a factor. An example of this is shown below. 

```{r factor-ex1}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
factor(x = factor_vector)
```

In addition to the main argument, `factor` also has some optional arguments. These include `levels`, `labels` and `exclude`. `levels` tells R what the order of the levels are of your factor (which is highest/lowest), if you leave it empty it will make the levels in alphabetical order or increasing order for integers. `labels` will create labels for your factor and will set the order of your factor. `exclude` will take out a level that appears in your factor and replace those values with `<NA>`. 

We can change the levels of our `factor_vector` from earlier using the `levels` argument.
```{r factor-levels}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
factor(x = factor_vector, levels = c(2,1,3)) ## set levels to 2,1,3
```


Using the `labels` argument, we can rename the levels of `factor_vector`. This will rename 1 to 'one', 2 to 'two' and 3 to 'three'.
```{r factor-labels}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
factor(x = factor_vector, labels = c('one', 'two', 'three')) ## set labels to 'one', 'two', 'three'
```

Using `exclude` we can exclude the number two from our factor.
```{r factor-exclude}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
factor(x = factor_vector, exclude = 2)
```

If you want to test if a column or set of data is a factor, you can use `is.factor`.

```{r is-factor}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
new_factor <- factor(x = factor_vector, exclude = 2)

is.factor(x = new_factor)
```

You can also check the levels of a factor using `levels`

```{r factor-levels-func}
factor_vector <- c(1,2,3)
new_factor <- factor(x = factor_vector)

levels(x = new_factor)
```


### Forcats

There are many useful functions in the `forcats` library but this lesson will mainly focus on `fct_relevel` and `fct_reorder` while also looking briefly at `fct_count`, `fct_c` and `fct_lump`.

#### `fct_count`

This function can be used to count the number of values in each level of your factor. It takes one main argument, the factor you want to count. The other optional arguments (`sort`, `prop`) sort the most common levels to the top and can compute the proportion of the levels represented.

```{r fct-count}
random_factor <- factor(x = c(1,1,1,2,3,4,2,3,2,1,4,3,3,3,2,1))
fct_count(random_factor)

fct_count(random_factor, sort = TRUE)

fct_count(random_factor, sort = TRUE, prop = TRUE)
```

#### `fct_c` 

This function takes factors with different levels and can combine them into one factor with the levels from the other factors. The only argument it takes are the factors you want to combine. We see that when using it on factors with levels 'a' and 'b' it will combine them into one factor with levels 'a' and 'b'. 

```{r fct-c}
factor_a <- factor(x = "a")
factor_b <- factor(x = "b")

fct_c(factor_a, factor_b)
```

#### `fct_lump` functions

This group of functions takes levels and brings them together to form a level called "other". The functions include:

  - `fct_lump_min:` This function takes a factor and a number which tells R whether to include the level in other. An optional argument is called `other_level`, this will change the name of the "other" level.
  - `fct_lump_prop:` This function will lump levels that appear less than a certain proportion of times. For example, you can lump functions that make up less than 15% of your data. 
  - `fct_lump_n:` This function lumps all of the levels except the n most frequent ones.
  
```{r fct-lump}
random_factor <- factor(x = c(1,1,1,2,3,4,2,3,2,1,4,3,3,3,2,1,1))

fct_lump_n(random_factor, n = 2) ## keep the 2 most frequent levels
fct_lump_prop(random_factor, prop = .25) ## lump levels which appear less than 25 % of time
fct_lump_min(random_factor, min = 3) ## lump levels which appear less than 3 times
```


#### `fct_reorder` 
This function is useful when working with factors because it allows you to reorder a factor you are working with by another variable. For example, you can reorder a factor with levels of different sports by the average height for the sports listed. The first argument for this function is the factor/variable you plan to re-order and the second will be the variable you are sorting the factor by.

Using the `expeditions` data which looks at Himalayan expeditions, we can reorder the levels of the seasons by the average peak height for each season. As you can see, by adding the `mutate` line we can change the order of the levels depending on the mean height reached that season.
```{r reorder-expedition}
data_ex <- expeditions %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(highpoint_metres, na.rm = T))

data_ex %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = mean_height)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Plot without fct_reorder")

data_ex %>% 
  mutate(season = fct_reorder(season, mean_height)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = mean_height)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Plot with fct_reorder")

data_sorted <- data_ex %>% 
  mutate(season = fct_reorder(season, desc(mean_height)))

levels(as.factor(data_ex$season))
levels(data_sorted$season)
```
We can see that the original order was alphabetical while the new sorted one is not.


`fct_reorder` can also be used to sort factors in descending order. We will use the same dataset, but this time we will order the levels of seasons decreasing by number of staff hired
```{r fct-reorder-desc}
crew_group <-expeditions %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(mean_staff = mean(hired_staff, na.rm = T))

crew_group %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = mean_staff)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Plot without fct_reorder")

crew_group %>% 
  mutate(season = fct_reorder(season, desc(mean_staff))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = mean_staff)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Plot with fct_reorder")

data_sorted <- crew_group %>% 
  mutate(season = fct_reorder(season, desc(mean_staff)))

levels(as.factor(crew_group$season))
levels(data_sorted$season)
```
Once again we see that the order of levels has switched from alphabetical to a different order.



#### `fct_relevel`

This function is used to change the levels of a factor. When R deals with levels in a factor, it sorts the levels of the factor in alphabetical order. This means that if your factor includes temperatures like "hot", "cold" and "medium", R will make the levels "cold", "hot", "medium". This can be tricky when classifying the factor because you may want it in increasing temperature or certain order. 

  - `fct_relevel` takes three arguments: the factor you want to relevel, the new order of the levels and `after` which tells R where you want the new order to occur (you can set `after=Inf` to bring your order to the end.)
  
If you have a factor with levels "hot", "cold" and "medium", R will sort the levels alphabetically, meaning the order will be "cold", "hot" and then "medium". `fct_relevel` is one way to put the levels in the correct order. There are many ways to change the order, you can either write the order yourself or just move hot to the end using `after = Inf`.

```{r fct-relevel}
temperatures <- factor(x = c("hot", "cold", "medium"))
levels(x = temperatures)

## use fct_relevel

fct_relevel(temperatures, "hot", after = Inf)
```

Another example of using `fct_relevel` is with the expedition data. We can use it to change the levels of the `termination_reason` to place Successful expeditions at the top of the levels.
```{r relevel-example}
termination_levels <- levels(as.factor(expeditions$termination_reason))
reordered_levels <- fct_relevel(termination_levels, "Success (claimed)", "Success (main peak)",
            "Success (subpeak)")

levels(x = reordered_levels)
```
Now we have successes at the top.

You can also include a function in `fct_relevel` to change up the order of your levels. You can use functions like `sample`, `sort` or `rev` to change the order. 
```{r relevel-rev}
termination_levels <- levels(as.factor(expeditions$termination_reason))
## use sample to make the order of levels randomized

levels(fct_relevel(termination_levels, sample))
```


### Exercises

These next exercises will use a dataset which looks at the various countries who have given gifts to the United States, along with the monetary value of these gifts. While the original dataset has almost every country in the world, we will focus on a smaller portion of the countries. 

```{r read-in-countries, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gifts <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/us-government-gifts/gifts.csv")

plot_countries <- c("Australia", "Canada", "Mexico", "Brazil", "Germany", "Italy", 
         "France", "Spain", "England")

gifts <- gifts %>% 
  filter(donor_country %in% plot_countries)

glimpse(gifts)
```


Using `fct_reorder` change the order of the `donor_country` levels to be in order of `mean_value`.

```{r forcats-test-1, exercise = TRUE}
gifts_grouped <- gifts %>% 
  group_by(donor_country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value_usd, na.rm = T))
### Enter solution below

```

```{r forcats-test-1-solution}
gifts_grouped <- gifts %>% 
  group_by(donor_country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value_usd, na.rm = T))
### Enter solution below
fct_reorder(gifts_grouped$donor_country, gifts_grouped$mean_value)
```

Now, using `fct_reorder` change the order of the `donor_country` levels to be decreasing by `mean_value`. (Bonus: use the new order to make a plot, steps are very similar to the earlier examples) 

```{r forcats-test-2, exercise = TRUE}
gifts_grouped <- gifts %>% 
  group_by(donor_country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value_usd, na.rm = T))
### Enter solution below

```

```{r forcats-test-2-solution}
gifts_grouped <- gifts %>% 
  group_by(donor_country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value_usd, na.rm = T))
### Enter solution below
fct_reorder(gifts_grouped$donor_country, desc(gifts_grouped$mean_value))

### BONUS
gifts_grouped %>% 
  mutate(donor_country = fct_reorder(donor_country, desc(mean_value))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(donor_country, mean_value)) +
  geom_col()
```


Using `fct_relevel`, change the order of the levels for `gifts$donor_country` to be randomly sampled.

```{r forcats-test-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r forcats-test-3-solution}
fct_relevel(gifts$donor_country, sample)
```

This final exercise will combine the uses of different `forcats` functions and will still use the `gifts` data. 
Using one of the `fct_lump_` functions, lump all but 5 of the `donor_country` levels into other (save it under `gifts_lumped`). Next, using `fct_relevel` change the order to be in a random order (save under `gifts_lumped` again). Finally, using a `forcats` function count how many entries are in each level.

```{r forcats-test-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r forcats-test-4-solution}
gifts_lumped <- fct_lump_n(gifts$donor_country, 5)
gifts_lumped <- fct_relevel(gifts_lumped, rev)
fct_count(gifts_lumped)
```



```{r forcats-mult-choice, results = "hide"}
factor_example <- factor(c(rep("dog", 20), rep("cat", 19), 
                    rep("fish", 12), rep("cow", 9),
                    rep("bird", 24)))

fct_relevel(factor_example, "fish", "dog") 

fct_lump_n(factor_example, 2)
```

```{r forcats-mult-choice-1, echo=F}
question("What is the order of the levels before we run `fct_relevel`?",
         answer("dog, cat, fish, cow, bird"),
         answer("bird, cat, cow, dog, fish", correct = TRUE),
         answer("bird, dog, cat, fish, cow"),
         answer("The order is random"),
         allow_retry = T)
```

```{r forcats-mult-choice-2, echo=F}
question("After running `fct_relevel` what is the new order of the levels?",
         answer("fish, dog, bird, cat, cow", correct = TRUE),
         answer("bird, cat, cow, dog, fish"),
         answer("fish, dog, other"),
         answer("The order is still random"),
         allow_retry = T)
```

```{r forcats-mult-choice-3, echo=F}
question("After running `fct_lump_n`, which 2 levels are kept out of other?",
         answer("bird", correct = TRUE),
         answer("cat"),
         answer("cow"),
         answer("dog", correct = TRUE),
         answer("fish"),
         allow_retry = T)
```


### Common Mistakes & Errors

- `Error: "f" must be a factor (or character vector).`
  - This error will occur if you try to call `forcats` functions on non-factors. To fix this, ensure you are using a factor. 
  
- `argument ".x" is missing, with no default`
  - This error will occur if you are missing an argument in your function call. Double check that you have filled out all arguments.

### Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the `forcats` package, here are some additional resources to help continue your learning:

- The `forcats` website which includes more examples and information about the most important functions: https://forcats.tidyverse.org/

- R for Data Science's chapter about factors. This chapter gives another lesson on factors and also uses the `forcats` package to work with factors: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html

## More on strings

Written by Annie Collins.

### More on strings

Written by Annie Collins.

#### Introduction

In this lesson, we will be covering some additional functions that will help us work with text data. If you have not already done so, please feel free to look through the previous lesson "Strings with paste and glue and stringr" for more functions and examples of working with strings that might help your understanding of this lesson's content.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Expand deliminated text data in a data frame using `separate()` and`separate_rows()`; and,
- Extract and manipulate text data in character vectors using `str_match()`, and `str_remove()`

Prerequisite skills include:

- Some knowledge from the previous strings lesson in this module, as well as the `stringr` and `tidyr` packages.

#### Separate text-based data frames using separate() and separate_rows()

`separate()` and `separate_rows()` allow you to split up a single column of text data in different ways.

`separate()` divides a single column of text data into multiple columns. There are several arguments that allow you to specify how this is done. We will focus on a the most significant ones to start:

| Argument | Parameter | Details
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| data     | data frame | A data frame |
| col | number OR string | The name or position of the column containing the data to be separated |
| into | vector | A character vector of the names you wish to give to the newly created columns. You can omit columns by putting `NA` in the corresponding place within this vector. The length of your input must match the largest number of columns produced by separating one of the cells in `col`, otherwise the excess columns will be omitted  |
| sep | number OR string | Indicates how text will be separated. Defaults to splitting at any non-alpha numeric characters. If you use a number, the column will split at the specified position within each string. If you use a character, the text will split at every instance of that character and the character will be omitted from the outputted columns. |

To see `separate()` in action, let's look at the following data frame called `dinner_party` which contains a list of guests for a dinner party and their food choices for a three course meal consisting of soup, salad, and a main course.

```{r}
guest <- c("Annie", "Mariam", "Haoluan", "Shirley", "Rohan", "Sam")
food <- c("butternut squash, ceasar, lasagna", "italian wedding, garden, chicken", "italian wedding, ceasar, lasagna", "italian wedding, ceasar, lasagna", "butternut squash, garden, chicken", "butternut squash, garden, lasagna")
dinner_party <- data.frame(guest, food)
dinner_party
```

Right now the guests' orders are listed together in the column called `food`, but the data might be easier to read if each person's order for each course was in its own column. Run the code below to see how this can be accomplished.

```{r separate-example-1, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

separate(dinner_party, food, c("soup", "salad", "main course"), sep = ",")

## We can also exlude the salad column in the output by using the following code instead
## separate(dinner_party, food, c("soup", NA, "main course"), sep = ",")

```

Using `separate()`, we now can see each course as its own column and all the commas have been removed. Note that it's important to specify `sep = ","` in this case, since the default option would separate by spaces as well and split soup orders into separate columns which is not what we intended.

We can split up the information contained in the `food` column in a different way using `separate_rows()`. As the name might suggest, this function will split each string into distinct rows instead of columns. The syntax and arguments are similar to `separate()`:

| Argument | Parameter | Details
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| data     | data frame | A data frame |
| ... | string | The name(s) of the column(s) containing the data to be separated. Multiple columns can be inputted if their lengths are compatible (i.e. the same number of new rows will be created once they are separated). Otherwise, an error will be raised. |
| sep | number OR string | Character between values to be separated. Defaults to any non-alpha-numeric characters. |

Notice that we don't need to worry about the name or number of new columns since none will be created. Once the data in the indicated column(s) has separated into additional rows, the data from accompanying columns will be duplicated to fill in the new row's remaining cells.

Run the code below and observe the difference between `separate()` and `separate_rows()`.

```{r separate-example-2, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
separate_rows(dinner_party, food, sep = ",")
```

#### Trouble Shooting separate()

Sometimes it is hard to know exactly how many columns your data will create when using `separate()`, which can lead to errors or unintended results when specifying the `into` argument. The function comes with a few *additional* arguments to help you control what happens in these scenarios. Note that this applies only when `sep` is a string, since if `sep` is numeric the column in question is always separated into two columns at the indicated location.

| Argument | Parameter | Details
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| extra | string | Used to control what happens if there are extra columns created once all the names from `sep` are used. There are two options (not including the default, "warn"): **"drop"**, which will exclude any additional columns created, or **"merge"**, which will split the text at most `length(into)` times (so the last column indicated by `into` will contain unseparated data). |
| fill | string | Used to control what happens if there are not enough columns created to match the names indicated in `into`. There are two options (not including the default, "warn"): **"right"**, which fills the data frame with missing values on the right, and **"left"**, which fills the data frame with missing values on the left of the actual data. |

Run and edit the code below and observe the difference between the scenarios.

```{r separate-exercise-3, exercise=TRUE}
letters <- data.frame(x = c("a.b", "a.b.c", "a.b.c.d"))
letters

## Too many columns created - try "drop" and "merge" in place of "warn"
separate(letters, x, c("A", "B"), extra = "warn")

## Not enough columns created - try "left" and "right" in place of "warn"
separate(letters, x, c("A", "B", "C", "D"), fill = "warn")

```


#### Working with text data using str_match() and str_remove()

`str_match()` and `str_remove()` are functions from the `stringr` package that can be used to manipulate character vectors in different ways.

`str_match()` identifies the first instance of a given pattern within each element of a character vector by returning a new vector indicating the string found that matches the pattern. This is particularly useful for data that follows a set structure, such as phone numbers or postal codes. `str_match()` returns a character matrix, in which the first column contains the complete match and subsequent columns contain any matching sub-groups within the full match. 

`str_remove()` removes the first instance of a given pattern within each string in a character vector, returning an updated character vector.

Both functions take the same two arguments:

| Argument | Parameter | Details
| -------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| string | vector | Your character vector |
| pattern | string | The pattern to look for in `string` (either a general pattern or a specific string). |

Consider this vector called `postal_codes` containing 30 Toronto postal codes.

```{r postal-codes, include=FALSE}
set.seed(900)
postal_codes <- c("M5S2W8")
front <- c("M5S", "M5R", "M5T", "M4W", "M4Y", "M4V")
i = 1
while (i < 30) {
  a <- sample(front, 1)
  b <- sample(1:9, 1)
  c <- sample(LETTERS, 1)
  d <- sample(1:9, 1)
  new <- paste0(a, b, c, d)
  postal_codes <- append(postal_codes, new)
  i <- i + 1
}
```
```{r}
postal_codes
```

Suppose we want to identify the postal codes in this vector from areas surrounding the University of Toronto, which begin with "M5S". We can use the code below to do so.

```{r}

str_match(postal_codes, "M5S[1-9][A-Z][1-9]") 
## The input for pattern here essentially means "M5S followed by any combination of the format number-letter-number"
```

We now have a vector containing only the postal codes of interest, and we could manipulate it further to remove the NA's if desired. Now suppose we actually wanted to remove these postal codes from the original data. This is where we could use `str_remove()`.

```{r}
str_remove(postal_codes, "M5S[1-9][A-Z][1-9]")
```

We now have a vector with blank strings instead of postal codes that begin with "M5S".

It is important to note that `str_match()` and `str_detect()` only operate on the first instance of the indicated pattern within each element of a string (this isn't so obvious in our postal code example since each string is rather simple and short). Both `str_match()` and `str_remove()` have accompanying functions `str_match_all()` and `str_remove_all()` which apply their functionality to *every* instance of the inputted pattern within the inputted character vector. Run the code below on a simpler vector to examine the difference.

```{r all-exercise-, exercise = TRUE}
## Match
rhyme <- c("she", "sells", "sea", "shells")

str_match(rhyme, "s")

str_match_all(rhyme, "s")
```
```{r all-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE}
## Remove
rhyme <- c("she", "sells", "sea", "shells")

str_remove(rhyme, "s")

str_remove_all(rhyme, "s")
```

#### Questions

These questions will refer to the following data set called `groceries`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
groceries <- data.frame(food = c("bananas,apples,rice,pasta,tofu,pizza"), drinks = c("tea,coffee,juice,wine"))
groceries
```

```{r separate-q-1, echo=FALSE}
question("How many rows will the output of \"separate_rows(groceries, drinks)\" have?",
         answer("4", correct=TRUE),
         answer("5"),
         answer("6"),
         answer("Error"))
```
```{r separate-q-2, echo=FALSE}
question("How many rows will the output of \"separate_rows(groceries, food, drinks)\" have?",
         answer("4"),
         answer("5"),
         answer("6"),
         answer("Error", correct = TRUE),
         correct = "Correct! Given the default \"sep\" value, \"drinks\" would separate into four new rows while \"food\" would separate into six, causing an error to be raised")
```
```{r separate-q-3, echo=FALSE}
question("Suppose I execute \"separate(groceries, drinks, into=c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"), fill=\"left\")\". What will the second column of the outputted data frame contain?",
         answer("bananas,apples,rice,pasta,tofu,pizza"),
         answer("tea"),
         answer("NA", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Error")
         )
```
```{r separate-q-4, echo=FALSE}
question("Suppose I execute \"separate(groceries, drinks, into=c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), extra=\"merge\")\". What will the final column of the outputted data frame contain?",
         answer("juice"),
         answer("wine"),
         answer("juice,wine", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Error")
         )
```

#### Exercises

##### Exercise 1

Replicate the following data set, beginning with `groceries` as above.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
groceries %>% separate(drinks, into=c("1", "2", "3", "4")) %>% separate_rows(food)

```

```{r separate-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r separate-exercise-1-solution}
groceries %>% separate(drinks, into=c("1", "2", "3", "4")) %>% separate_rows(food)
## Can switch order of the functions for the same result
```

##### Exercise 3

Using the `postal_codes` data from previous examples, remove every number from the data.

```{r remove-exercise-1, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r remove-exercise-1-solution}
postal_codes %>% str_remove_all("[1-9]")
```


##### Exercise 2

Using the `postal_codes` data from previous examples, create a vector that contains only the last three characters of all postal codes beginning with "M5S".
```{r remove-exercise-2, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r remove-exercise-2-solution}
postal_codes %>% str_match("M5S[1-9][A-Z][1-9]") %>% str_remove("M5S")
```

#### Next Steps

Now that you are familiar with some functions that work with strings, you are well set up to explore other features that `stringr` has to offer. A good place to start is the `stringr` [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf) which outlines a myriad of tools for working with strings and text-based data in R.

















## Regular expressions

Written by Shirley Deng.

To use the `stringr` package, we can describe patterns in strings using regular expressions, or regex. This section will outline a variety of regex examples :\^)

For the examples below, we have a grocery list stored as the vector `groceries`.

```{r regex-data}
groceries <- c("Bananas", "strawberries", "Sliced bread", 
               "2 lb ground beef", "blueberries", "frozen raspberry", 
               "red color plums", "frozen Mixed-Berries", "yellow colour plums")
```

### Starting with the basics

Say we're interested in seeing how many different types of berries are on our list. 

We can match exact strings by simply using them as the `pattern` argument in our chosen `stringr` function. Here, we are using `stringr::str_subset()`

```{r regex-exact, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "berries")
```

### Wrapping our package

When we use a plain string for the `pattern` argument, R reads it by wrapping it in the `regex()` function.

```{r regex-wrap, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, regex("berries"))
```

Notice that whether we use `stringr::str_subset()` with `"berries"` or `regex("berries")` as our pattern argument, the results are the same.

### Insensitive about cases

Notice that in the above examples, `str_subset()` was case sensitive and did not return the `"Mixed Berries"` item in our `groceries` list.

However, if we include the argument `ignore_case=T` in `regex()`, it will.

```{r regex-case, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, regex("Berries", ignore_case=T))
```

Note: if we want to use options other than the default for `regex()`, we have to explicitly wrap our pattern criteria in the `regex()` function.

### Period.

Notice that the item `"frozen raspberry"` is a berry, but was not returned in the earlier examples because we were only searching for the plural spelling `"berries"`.

The period `.` is used to match any character except the newline `\n`, so we can use the common part `"berr"` to include `"frozen raspberry"`.

```{r regex-period, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, ".berr.")
```

However, if we did want to include the newline `\n`, then we can explicitly state this in the `regex()` arguments as well using `dotall=T`. Here, we use the `stringr` function `str_detect()`:

```{r regex-all, exercise=T}
str_detect("\nGroceries\n", ".G.")
str_detect("\nGroceries\n", regex(".G.", dotall=T))
```

### From start to finish

Alternatively, we can also search for strings that start or end with a certain pattern by using anchors.

For example, if we wanted all frozen items in `groceries`, we can use the caret `^` to indicate the start of a string and search for items beginning with "frozen":

```{r regex-start, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "^frozen")
```

Or if we wanted all varieties of plums in `groceries`, we can use the dollar sign `$` to indicate the end of a string and search for all items ending with "plums":

```{r regex-finish, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "plums$")
```

Some [additional anchors](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf) are as follows: 

Syntax   |   Use 
---|--- 
`^` | start of the string 
`$` | end of the string 
`\\b` | empty string at either edge of a word 
`\\B` | not the edge of a word 
`\\<` | beginning of a word 
`\\>` | end of a word 

### Or how about...

Or how about we try explicitly searching for all of `"berries"`,  `"Berries"`, and `"berry"`? We can do so with the alternation operator, `|`, which means "or".

```{r regex-or, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "berries|Berries|berry")
```

Alternatively, we can also use parentheses `()` to write this more concisely. The parantheses essentially do the same thing they do in BEDMAS/PEDMAS for math: indicate grouping.

```{r regex-or-parent, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "(b|B)err(ies|y)")
```

### Color or colour?

Notice that in we have spelled both "color" and "colour" in `groceries`. Suppose we wanted to find all of the items that had their colour indicated.

There are a variety of ways we could do this using the tools we have so far.

For example, using the alternation operator `|`:

```{r regex-colour-or, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "color|colour")
```

Or, using parentheses `()` too:

```{r regex-colour-parent, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "colo(r|ur)")
```

Alternatively, we can also use repetition quantifiers.

For example, the question mark `?` indicates that the preceding item is optional, and can be matched up to once. We can thus us `?` to indicate that the "u" in "colour" is optional:

```{r regex-colour-q, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "colou?r")
```

Below is a list of some of these [repetition operators](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf): 

Syntax   | Use
---|---
`?`   |   The preceding item is optional and will be matched at most once 
`*`   |   The preceding item will be matched zero or more times 
`+`   |   The preceding item will be matched one or more times 
`{n}`   |   The preceding item is matched exactly n times 
`{n,}`   |   The preceding item is matched n or more times 
`{n,m}`   |   The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times 

### Building character

Suppose we wanted to search for all items in `groceries` that have amounts provided. How many lbs of beef do we need? Is the number of plums specified?

One way we could do this is to search for digits altogether. Using our current knowledge of regex, we could use the following:

```{r regex-bad-digits, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9")
```

R has syntax for classes of characters, though. And in this case, the class of digits is referred to with `[:digit:]`. 

Below is a list of some [character classes](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf):

Syntax  |  Use
---|---
`[:alnum:]`   |   Alphanumeric characters: `[:alpha:]` and `[:digit:]` 
`[:alpha:]`   |   Alphabetic characters: `[:lower:]` and `[:upper:]`
`[:blank:]`   |   Blank characters: space and tab, and possibly other locale-dependent characters such as non-breaking space 
`[:cntrl:]`   |   Control characters. In ASCII, these characters have octal codes 000 through 037, and 177 (DEL). In another character set, these are the equivalent characters, if any 
`[:digit:]`   |   Digits: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9` 
`[:graph:]`   |   Graphical characters: `[:alnum:]` and `[:punct:]` 
`[:lower:]`   |   Lower-case letters in the current locale 
`[:print:]`   |   Printable characters: `[:alnum:]`, `[:punct:]` and space 
`[:punct:]`   |   Punctuation characters: `` ` ``, `!`, `"`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `.`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `{`, `|`, `}`, and `~`
`[:space:]`   |   Space characters: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, space, and possibly other locale-dependent characters 
`[:upper:]`   |   Upper-case letters in the current locale 
`[:xdigit:]`   |   Hexadecimal digits: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`

We can also build our own [character classes](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf), though. For example:

Syntax  |  Use
---|---
`[xyz]`   |   would match `x`, `y`, or `z` 
`[a-z]`   |   would match every character between `a` and `z` in Unicode code point order 
`[^xyz]`  |   would match anything except `x`, `y`, or `z`
`[\~\!]`   |   would match `~` or `!`

Whenever we want to use a pre-built character class like `[:digit:]`, we have to wrap it in an extra set of square brackets `[]`. 

Thus, we can use this:

```{r regex-digit-pre, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "[[:digit:]]")
```

Or this:

```{r regex-digit-built, exercise=T}
str_subset(groceries, "[0123456789]")
```

To search for all items in `groceries` that have amounts provided:

### Help me escape!

Recall from the R markdown section that there were a number of special characters that we needed to escape with `\` in order to get them to show up, rather than perform some code-y function. These special characters are called **metacharacters**.

Additionally, recall that the newline character is indicated with `\n`. However, it's not the only such character with this kind of special syntax. Below are some more of these special characters, also called [metacharacters](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf): 

Syntax  |  Use
---|---
`\n`   |   new line 
`\r`   |   carriage return 
`\t`   |   tab 
`\v`   |   vertical tab 
`\f`   |   form feed

Now, what if we wanted to match a pattern containing `*`, `+`, or `\t`, for example?

Consider the following list `spam`:

```{r regex-spam}
spam <- c("2*2=4", "raining cats and dogs", "they\them", "they/them", "heurex.se", "peanut butter")
```

We can try to match these metacharacters as usual:

```{r regex-fail, exercise=T}
str_detect(spam, "*|+|\t")
```

But we get an error.

In order to use these metacharacters as literal characters, we can either escape them by using `\\`:

```{r regex-escape-slash, exercise=T}
str_subset(spam, "(\\*)|(\\+)|(\\\t)")
```

Or by enclosing them between `\\Q` and `\\E`:

```{r regex-escape-enclose, exercise=T}
str_subset(spam, "\\Q*\\E|\\Q+\\E|\\Q\t\\E")
```

### Functioning functions

Alternatively, instead of using the `stringr` package, we can also use some of the following [base R functions](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf): 

Function   |   Use 
---|---
`grep()`, `grepl()`   |   These functions search for matches of a regular expression/pattern in a character vector. `grep()` returns the indices into the character vector that contain a match or the specific strings that happen to have the match. `grepl()` returns a `T`/`F` vector indicating which elements of the character vector contain a match
`regexpr()`, `gregexpr()`   |    Search a character vector for regular expression matches and return the indices of the string where the match begins and the length of the match 
`sub()`, `gsub()`   |    Search a character vector for regular expression matches and replace that match with another string
`regexec()`   |    This function searches a character vector for a regular expression, much like `regexpr()`, but it will additionally return the locations of any parenthesized sub-expressions. Probably easier to explain through demonstration.

## Working with dates

Written by Mariam Walaa.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Work with dates using the `lubridate` library

Prerequisite skills include:

- Loading libraries
- Using `mutate()` and `summarise()`

Highlights:

- Loading the `lubridate` library separately from `tidyverse`
- Making use of the `today()` and `now()` functions
- Learning how to extract information from a date-time column


### Overview

Let's start by loading the `tidyverse`.

```{r dates-1, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Notice that `lubridate` is not listed as one of the libraries loaded into your R session
when you load `tidyverse` (which you can view in your output on your own RStudio), and this
is because it is not part of the core `tidyverse` so it will need to be loaded separately.

```{r dates-2}
library(lubridate)
```

Two of the functions the `lubridate` library will give us is `today()` and `now()`, which we can
immediately start to use, without data or parameters.

```{r dates-3}
today()
```

```{r dates-4}
now()
```

We will look at Caribou data from Alex Cooksons dataset repository for this tutorial.

```{r dates-5, include = FALSE}
caribou <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tacookson/data/master/caribou-location-tracking/locations.csv")
```

```{r dates-6}
glimpse(caribou)
```

We can see that the timestamp column has an associated data type 'dttm.' This stands for
datetime.

Given this is already the correct data type, we can extract a lot of information from it
using `lubridate` functions.

```{r dates-7}
# extracting year
caribou %>% mutate(year = year(timestamp))

# extracting week day
caribou %>% mutate(week_day = wday(timestamp))

# extracting whether it's a leap year!
caribou %>% mutate(leap_year = leap_year(timestamp))
```

You can see there are many possibilities with the `lubridate` package. Check out the
cheatsheet to learn more.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1

Extract month, day, and year into separate columns at once using mutate.

```{r dates-exercise-1, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r dates-exercise-1-sol, echo = FALSE}
dates_ex1_sol <- caribou %>% mutate(month = month(timestamp),
                              day = day(timestamp),
                              year = year(timestamp))
```
```{r dates-exercise-1-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, dates_ex1_sol)))
```

#### Exercise 2

Find the earliest and latest dates in the timestamp column.

```{r dates-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r dates-exercise-2-sol, echo = FALSE}
dates_ex2_sol <- caribou %>% summarise(min(timestamp), max(timestamp))
```
```{r dates-exercise-2-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, dates_ex2_sol)))
```

**Hint**: Remember the summary functions you learned in `summarize()` tutorial!

### Common Mistakes & Errors

- You might try to apply `lubridate` functions on to a column that looks like a timestamp
column, but it may still not be of the appropriate data type, which is either 'dt', 'tm',
or 'dttm'. Be sure to convert to the proper data type first!

## `janitor`

Written by Mariam Walaa.

### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Improve column names in your dataset
- Handle duplicate or partially-duplicate data

Prerequisite skills include:

- Installing and loading packages

Highlights:

- You can make column names cleaner using janitors clean_names() function
- You can handle duplicate or partially duplicate data using janitors get_dupes() function

### Overview

> "The [janitor](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html) package is a R package
that has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. The main janitor
functions: perfectly format data frame column names; isolate partially-duplicate records;
and provide quick tabulations (i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs)."

As the description says, the janitor package will help you with cleaning any dirty dataset
you have. It is not part of the tidyverse so you will have to install it and then load it
separately as follows.

```{r janitor-1}
library(janitor)
```

One important thing in data analysis that you will see up come up very frequently when you
work with your datasets is _duplication_. This is one area where the janitor package will
help.

Another more obvious area that the janitor package will help with is your column names. We
don't always get to choose our column names (because most times, we are not creating our
own data, but were getting data from another source), so sometimes we might end up
with column names that are not easy to work with.

You can also do more cool things with the janitor package like creating crosstabs, but for
this tutorial, we will just focus mainly on how to make your dataset cleaner with better
variable names and handling duplicate data.

### Arguments

### clean_names()

The `clean_names()` function takes the following as arguments:

| Argument | Parameter            | Details                                        |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| dat*     | input data frame     |                                                |
| case     | 'title' for big caps | default is 'snake'; see to_any_case for more   |

You can read more about the arguments in the `clean_names()` function's documentation
[here](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html#clean_names()).

### get_dupes()

The `get_dupes()` function takes the following as arguments:

| Argument | Parameter        | Details                                         |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| dat*     | input data frame |                                                 |
| …        | vector           | vector containing column names we want to check |

You can read more about the arguments in the `get_dupes()` function's documentation
[here](https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/janitor.html#get_dupes()).

### Exercises

Let's start by loading tidyverse since we'll be needing the pipe function, etc.
```{r janitor-2}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r janitor-data, include = FALSE}
grades <- tibble(`Student Initials` = c("AH", "AE", "HS", "ES", "BT"),
                 `Grade Midterm 1` = c(100, 86, 90, 64, 100),
                 `Grade Midterm 2` = c(90, 83, 79, 64, 90),
                 `Final Grade %` = c(95, 84.5, 84.5, 64, 95))
```

Consider this small dataset of grades.

```{r janitor-3}
grades
```

Using the clean_names() function from janitor, we get:

```{r janitor-4}
grades %>% clean_names()
```

Notice how now everything is lowercased with _ as a separator, and any special characters
like % are converted to words to retain their meaning. clean_names() would also handle
column names that are duplicated, but that's not demonstrated here since we already had
unique columns.

#### Exercise 1

If, for some reason, you wanted to preserve some existing columns from being cleaned, how
would you use the clean_names() function on only the columns you want to clean? For
example, supposed you wanted to keep the Final Grade % column as is.

**Hint**: You'll need to use functions outside of the janitor package to help with this!
Remember the dplyr functions.

```{r janitor-exercise-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r janitor-exercise-1-solution, exercise = FALSE}
grades %>%
  select(-`Final Grade %`) %>%
  clean_names()
```

```{r janitor-exercise-1-code-check}
grade_code()
```

#### Exercise 2

If you wanted to restore the upper casing for some columns, how would you do that?

**Tip**: Take a look at the Arguments section and see what you can use!

Store the cleaned data from above in an object called 'clean', then apply the new cleaning
step to it.

```{r janitor-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE}
clean <- 
clean %>%
```

```{r janitor-exercise-2-solution, exercise = FALSE}
clean <- grades %>% clean_names()
clean %>% clean_names(case = "title")
```

```{r janitor-exercise-2-code-check}
grade_code()
```

#### Exercise 3

Try using the `get_dupes()` function to get duplicate rows from the cleaned grades data
`clean`.

```{r include = FALSE}
clean <- grades %>% clean_names()
```

```{r janitor-exercise-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r janitor-exercise-3-solution, exercise = FALSE}
clean %>% get_dupes()
```

```{r janitor-exercise-3-code-check}
grade_code()
```

What was the result? Did you get anything?

#### Exercise 4

Look at the data carefully and try to see why you didn't get anything even though it looks
like two rows are very similar. How can you modify the function call so that you get the
_partially_ duplicate data?

```{r janitor-exercise-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r janitor-exercise-4-solution, exercise = FALSE}
clean %>% get_dupes(c("grade_midterm_1", "grade_midterm_2", "final_grade_percent"))
```

```{r janitor-exercise-4-code-check}
grade_code()
```

## `tidyr`

Written by Mariam Walaa.


### Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Do more with `tidyr` functions, such as advanced nesting

Prerequisite skills include:

- Previous tutorials involving `tidyr` functions

Highlights:

- Hello World: Using `tidyr` functions to clean a non-tidy dataset
- Advanced nesting

### Overview

When it comes to creating and working with datasets, one key point is *standardization*.
Datasets must be standardized! Imagine if every dataset was unique in its structure, how
difficult it would be for data scientists and analysts to work on them. Everyone would
have a vastly different workflow needed to reach the analysis step, and people would have
a harder time collaborating with each other and evaluating each other's results. That is
why datasets must be *standardized*.

You may ask yourself: How do we standardize a dataset, and to what extent? In [Hadley
Wickham's Tidy Data paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) from 2014, Hadley
introduces 3 rules every dataset must follow in order to be considered tidy.

This is a good paper to read, but if you don't have time, here is an illustration that
summarizes these 3 rules, by Allison Horst.

```{r tidyr-image-1, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/59_tidy-data.jpg")
```

Credits: Allison Horst

As the title says, this section will provide you with a summary of some functions you have
met in previous tutorials, as well as introduce you to some more functions from tidyr that
you havent met yet.

```{r tidyr-image-2, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/59_tidy-data-2.jpg")
```

Credits: Allison Horst

As you may have already heard, tidying data (and data preparation, in general) is a big
part of data analysis! In fact, it may be even bigger than other parts of data analysis.
So if you feel overwhelmed while learning how to tidy or clean a dataset, dont worry,
its natural and there's a lot to digest, especially because datasets can be so uniquely
messy (as Hadley Wickham's quote says in the picture above)

Instead of worrying about how to clean your dataset, though, we can start off a little
easier, and just try to get a grasp for what each function is for and maybe even a little
bit about how they work behind the scenes (You might find it helpful to try to understand
what the function is doing behind the scenes, and that way, you'll be able to better
remember what it does and why it does it).

### Hello world

Suppose you're given this data that is not in tidy format. 

```{r tidyr-data, include = FALSE}
nontidy_data <- tibble(n_lines = list(100, 200, 300),
                       n_figures = list(4, 5, 6),
                       n_scripts = list(10, 20, 30))

nontidy_data <- nontidy_data %>%
    rownames_to_column() %>%
    pivot_longer(-rowname, 'variable', 'value') %>%
    pivot_wider(variable, rowname)
```

```{r tidyr-1}
nontidy_data
```

First, the columns and rows are switched, and second, the cells are all hidden.

Here is the code we need to tidy it:

```{r tidyr-2}
nontidy_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -variable, names_to = "name", values_to = "value") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable") %>%
  unnest(everything())
```

Lets go through this step by step and check the output each time.

To clean it, we will use our functions pivot_longer(), pivot_wider(), and unnest() from tidyr. 

```{r tidyr-3}
# 1. Convert to long format
nontidy_data_l <- nontidy_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -variable, names_to = 'name', values_to = 'value')
nontidy_data_l
```

Our dataset is in a long format now.

```{r tidyr-4}
# 2. Convert to wide format
nontidy_data_w <- nontidy_data_l %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = 'variable')
nontidy_data_w
```

Notice how step 2 brings the variable names to the top.

```{r tidyr-4-again}
# 3. Unnest (or unfold) the cells
tidy_data <- nontidy_data_w %>%
  unnest(everything())
tidy_data
```

Now it is tidy data. You can also clean it up as follows:

```{r tidyr-5}
tidy_data %>%
  column_to_rownames('name')
```

### Exercises

Lets start with loading the tidyverse.

```{r tidyr-6, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We will be looking at a data set of Broadway shows with variables about the performances,
attendance, and revenue for theaters that are part of The Broadway League. You can learn
more about the data set provided by Alex Cookson in this [Git
repository](https://github.com/tacookson/data) as well as this corresponding [blog
post](https://www.alexcookson.com/post/most-successful-broadway-show-of-all-time/).

Take a look at a subset of this data for the Winter Garden Theatre.

```{r tidyr-8}
winter_garden
```

Click Next to look through the observations.

#### Exercise 1

```{r tidyr-exercise-1, echo = FALSE}
question("Without using the nest() function, how many rows and columns do we have after nesting?",
         answer("2 rows and 2 columns", correct = TRUE),
         answer("44 rows and 2 columns"),
         answer("44 rows and 3 columns"),
         answer("2 rows and 3 columns"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

#### Exercise 2

Try the nest() function. Do you get the expected result?

```{r tidyr-exercise-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyr-exercise-2-sol, echo = FALSE}
tidyr_ex2_sol <- winter_garden %>% nest(data = c(show))
```
```{r tidyr-exercise-2-check}
grade_result(pass_if(~identical(.result, tidyr_ex2_sol)))
```

#### Exercise 3

```{r tidyr-exercise-3, echo = FALSE}
question("Consider the code from Exercise 2. What would the sizes of each of the nested data frames be?",
         answer("22 rows by 1 column", correct = TRUE),
         answer("1 row by 22 columns"),
         answer("44 rows by 1 column"),
         answer("1 row by 44 columns"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

#### Exercise 4

```{r tidyr-exercise-4, echo = FALSE}
question("Consider the code from Exercise 2. Without using the unnest_longer() function, how many rows and columns are in this dataset after unnesting longer?",
         answer("22 rows by 1 column"),
         answer("1 row by 22 columns"),
         answer("44 rows by 2 columns", correct = TRUE),
         answer("1 row by 44 columns"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

#### Exercise 5

Take a look at another subset of the data set, for Palace Theatre this time. 

```{r tidyr-data-2-1}
palace
```

```{r tidyr-exercise-5, echo = FALSE}
question("Which of these functions gives us 12 rows and 2 columns?",
         answer("nest()", correct = TRUE),
         answer("unnest()"),
         answer("unnest_wider()"),
         answer("unnest_longer()"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE)
```

this tutorial, but if you are interested, then this might be helpful.










## Summary, and next steps


In this level, we touched on some useful data manipulation methods that you'll come across fairly often.

You can start the next lesson by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("to_ggplot_or_not_to_ggplot", package = "DoSStoolkit")
